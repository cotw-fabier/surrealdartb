## Structural Verification (Checks 1-2)

### Check 1: Requirements Accuracy
PASSED - All user answers accurately captured in requirements.md

Verification of user responses against requirements.md:

1. **Q1 - Priority Order**: User approved suggested priority
   - requirements.md line 18: "APPROVED - (1) CRUD operations, (2) authentication, (3) data methods, (4) parameter methods, (5) function execution, (6) advanced features"
   - Status: ACCURATELY CAPTURED

2. **Q2 - Live Queries**: User chose "Streams sounds excellent here"
   - requirements.md line 21: "Use Dart Streams (Stream<Notification>)"
   - Status: ACCURATELY CAPTURED

3. **Q3 - Error Handling**: User chose "expansion is justified here"
   - requirements.md line 24: "EXPAND the exception hierarchy (add AuthenticationException, TransactionException, LiveQueryException, etc.)"
   - Status: ACCURATELY CAPTURED

4. **Q4 - Type Mapping**: User chose "Dart equivalents sounds ideal"
   - requirements.md line 27: "Create Dart equivalents for Rust SDK types (RecordId, Datetime, Duration, etc.)"
   - Status: ACCURATELY CAPTURED

5. **Q5 - Transaction API**: User chose "The second one sounds like the best implementation since we're building a dart wrapper"
   - requirements.md line 30: "Use idiomatic Dart pattern: `await db.transaction((txn) => { ... })`"
   - Status: ACCURATELY CAPTURED

6. **Q6 - Insert Builder**: User said "I think the chaining makes the most sense since it will mirror SurrealDB the closest. However I'm not sure if this presents any specific technical challenges. If it doesn't seem too difficult to implement I would lean to doing this."
   - requirements.md line 33: "Use method chaining (insert().content(), insert().relation()) - BUT only if not too difficult technically"
   - Status: ACCURATELY CAPTURED including conditional fallback

7. **Q7 - Authentication Credentials**: User said "Let's create typed classes"
   - requirements.md line 36: "Create typed classes (RootCredentials, DatabaseCredentials, ScopeCredentials)"
   - Status: ACCURATELY CAPTURED

8. **Q8 - Export/Import Config**: User said "Don't worry about config at this moment in time"
   - requirements.md line 39: "Defer configuration support to future iteration (basic export/import only)"
   - Status: ACCURATELY CAPTURED

9. **Q9 - Upsert Patch Variant**: User said "A class would be ideal"
   - requirements.md line 42: "Create a Dart PatchOp class with methods"
   - Status: ACCURATELY CAPTURED

10. **Q10 - Testing Strategy**: User said "Let's stay focused on local embedded databases for the time being. Right now we have in-memory and rocksdb. Those are the only two we should focus on for this spec run."
    - requirements.md line 45: "Focus ONLY on embedded mode (in-memory and rocksdb) - NO remote server tests"
    - Status: ACCURATELY CAPTURED

11. **Q11 - Special Cases**: User said "Just what you envision. I don't have anything specific in mind."
    - requirements.md line 48: "Use your best judgment"
    - Status: ACCURATELY CAPTURED

12. **Q12 - Limitations**: User said "If a feature is remote db only, then it can be left out during this run. If a feature won't work in an FFI context then document and leave it out during this run."
    - requirements.md line 51: "Exclude remote-only features and FFI-incompatible features, document them clearly"
    - Status: ACCURATELY CAPTURED

**Additional Context Captured:**
- requirements.md lines 53-60: Existing code reference section properly notes "No similar existing features identified for reference" - CORRECT, this is greenfield on existing FFI foundation
- requirements.md lines 73-100: Current implementation status accurately documented with existing Database methods
- requirements.md lines 407-419: Reusability opportunities from current codebase accurately documented

CONCLUSION: All 12 user answers plus additional context accurately captured with no discrepancies.

### Check 2: Visual Assets
PASSED - No visual assets expected or found (SDK/API specification)

Visual asset check results:
- No visual files found in planning/visuals/ directory (expected result from ls command)
- requirements.md lines 62-67 correctly states: "No visual assets provided" and "N/A - This is an SDK/API implementation spec, not a UI feature"
- spec.md line 95: "Not applicable - This is an SDK/API specification without UI components"

CONCLUSION: Correctly documents absence of visual assets for API-only specification.

### Check 7: Reusability and Over-Engineering Check

**Unnecessary New Components:**

PASSED - No unnecessary new components identified:

- All 7 new type definitions are necessary (cannot reuse Dart's built-in types for SurrealDB-specific semantics):
  - RecordId: SurrealDB table:id format not representable with Dart types
  - Datetime: SurrealDB datetime != Dart DateTime (different serialization)
  - Duration: SurrealDB duration syntax != Dart Duration (string parsing needed)
  - PatchOp: JSON Patch RFC 6902 operations not in standard library
  - Jwt: Wrapper for token security (matches Rust SDK pattern)
  - Notification<T>: Live query-specific notification structure
  - Credentials hierarchy: Type-safe authentication pattern

- Builder classes conditional (spec.md lines 146-151): "if technically feasible" with documented fallback
- No duplicate UI components (API-only specification)

**Duplicated Logic:**

PASSED - Reuses existing patterns:

- spec.md lines 99-134: Documents extensive existing code to leverage
- FFI call wrapping pattern: Reuses Future(() {...}) from database.dart
- Response processing: Reuses `_processResponse()` helper
- Error extraction: Reuses `_getLastErrorString()` pattern
- Memory cleanup: Reuses try/finally pattern
- Exception hierarchy: Extends existing DatabaseException base

**Missing Reuse Opportunities:**

PASSED - No missing opportunities:

- User provided no similar features to reuse (requirements.md line 55: "No similar existing features identified")
- Specification correctly identifies this as "greenfield implementation building on the basic FFI foundation"
- All existing FFI patterns properly documented and referenced for reuse

**Justification for New Code:**

PASSED - Clear justification for all new code:

- New methods: Required for SDK parity (user's goal)
- New types: Required for SurrealDB type semantics
- New exceptions: Required for specific error categories (user Q3: expansion justified)
- New builders: Conditional based on technical feasibility (user Q6: if not too difficult)
- All justified by user requirements

CONCLUSION: No over-engineering detected. All new code justified by user requirements. Existing patterns properly leveraged.

## Critical Issues

NONE - Specification ready for implementation.

## Minor Issues

NONE - All requirements accurately captured and properly scoped.

## Over-Engineering Concerns

NONE - Appropriate scope with justified complexity:

1. Builder pattern is conditional with documented fallback (spec.md lines 146-151, 686-688)
2. All 7 type definitions necessary for SurrealDB semantics (cannot reuse Dart built-ins)
3. Exception hierarchy expansion approved by user (Q3: "expansion is justified")
4. Test count appropriate: 37-103 tests for complete SDK parity (11 task groups + integration)
5. Live query complexity acknowledged and properly scoped (HIGH COMPLEXITY label, 7-10 day estimate)

## Recommendations

NONE - Specification is comprehensive, accurate, and ready for implementation.

The specification:
1. Accurately captures all 12 user requirements
2. Follows user's approved priority order
3. Implements conditional builder pattern with fallback
4. Defers export/import configuration as requested
5. Focuses testing on embedded mode only (memory and RocksDB)
6. Documents limitations as requested
7. Follows limited testing approach (2-8 tests per task group, ~37-103 total)
8. References existing FFI patterns appropriately
9. Complies with all user standards and preferences
10. Includes no scope creep or over-engineering

## Conclusion

PASSED - Specifications accurately reflect all user requirements, follow the approved limited testing approach (2-8 tests per task group, approximately 37-103 total tests), and properly leverage existing code patterns. The specification is ready for implementation with no critical issues, no minor issues, and no over-engineering concerns.

All user responses from the Q&A are faithfully captured in requirements.md. The spec.md and tasks.md properly scope the work to embedded mode only, use the user's approved patterns (Streams, callback transactions, typed classes, builder pattern with fallback), defer configuration as requested, and document limitations clearly. Testing strategy follows the limited focused approach with appropriate test counts.

The specification demonstrates excellent requirements alignment and is fully compliant with user standards for tech stack, coding style, error handling, and testing.
