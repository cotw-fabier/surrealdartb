# Task 8.2: Documentation & Examples

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #8.2 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-21-sdk-parity/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
This task was responsible for creating comprehensive documentation and examples for all newly implemented SDK features. The goal was to ensure that all public APIs are well-documented with usage examples, the README is updated with new features, embedded vs remote mode differences are clearly explained, and the example app demonstrates all major features.

## Implementation Summary

This implementation provides comprehensive documentation coverage for all SDK parity features implemented in Task Groups 1-4. The documentation includes:

1. **README Updates**: Added extensive sections covering CRUD operations (get, insert*, upsert*), authentication methods (signin, signup, authenticate, invalidate), parameter management (set, unset), function execution (run, version), type definitions (RecordId, Datetime, SurrealDuration, PatchOp, Jwt, Credentials), and embedded vs remote mode differences.

2. **Example Scenarios**: Created two new interactive example scenarios demonstrating authentication workflows and parameter/function usage, complete with error handling and embedded mode limitations documentation.

3. **Type Definition Documentation**: Documented usage patterns for all type definitions with practical code examples showing serialization, parsing, and real-world usage.

4. **API Reference**: All methods already have dartdoc comments with examples (implemented during feature development in previous task groups).

5. **Embedded Mode Clarity**: Created detailed "Embedded vs Remote Mode" section explaining what works, limitations, and migration path for users who need remote functionality.

Note: Features marked with * (insert, upsert, live queries, transactions, export/import) are documented as "under testing" since Task Groups 5.1, 6.1, and 7.1 are not yet implemented. Documentation focuses on what has been completed and tested (Task Groups 1-4).

## Key Implementation Details

### README Documentation
**Location:** `/Users/fabier/Documents/code/surrealdartb/README.md`

Added comprehensive sections including:
- **CRUD Operations**: Documented create, get, select, update, delete with code examples
- **Advanced CRUD**: Noted insert/upsert as "under testing" - directing users to stable alternatives
- **Authentication Methods**: Full documentation of signin, signup, authenticate, invalidate with all credential types
- **Parameter Management**: Set/unset documentation with security use cases and examples
- **Function Execution**: Built-in and user-defined function examples
- **Type Definitions**: Detailed documentation of RecordId, Datetime, SurrealDuration, PatchOp, Jwt, Credentials
- **Embedded vs Remote Mode**: Clear section explaining what works, limitations, and migration guide
- **API Reference**: Quick reference for all public methods with signatures
- **Complete Examples**: Real-world patterns for authentication flows, parameterized queries, graph relationships

**Rationale:** The README serves as the primary entry point for developers. Comprehensive documentation here ensures users can quickly understand capabilities and limitations.

### Authentication Scenario
**Location:** `/Users/fabier/Documents/code/surrealdartb/example/scenarios/authentication.dart`

Demonstrates:
- Root, database, and scope-level signin
- Signup with scope credentials
- JWT token extraction and storage patterns
- Token authentication (resuming sessions)
- Session invalidation
- Clear warnings about embedded mode limitations

**Rationale:** Authentication is complex with multiple credential types. An interactive scenario helps developers understand the patterns and embedded mode behavior.

### Parameters & Functions Scenario
**Location:** `/Users/fabier/Documents/code/surrealdartb/example/scenarios/parameters_functions.dart`

Demonstrates:
- Setting and using parameters in queries
- Parameter reuse patterns
- Built-in SurrealQL functions (rand, string, math, time)
- Custom user-defined functions
- Database version retrieval
- SQL injection prevention via parameters

**Rationale:** Parameters are crucial for security (preventing SQL injection) and reusability. This scenario teaches best practices through hands-on examples.

### Example App Updates
**Location:** `/Users/fabier/Documents/code/surrealdartb/example/cli_example.dart`

Updated menu to include:
- Scenario 4: Authentication Features
- Scenario 5: Parameters & Functions
- Updated menu choice handling (1-6 instead of 1-4)

**Rationale:** Interactive examples provide the best learning experience. Users can run and modify scenarios to understand features.

### Embedded vs Remote Documentation
**Location:** Section in `/Users/fabier/Documents/code/surrealdartb/README.md`

Created clear section explaining:
- What works in embedded mode (all CRUD, parameters, functions, authentication with limitations)
- Embedded mode limitations (authentication, live queries use polling vs WebSocket)
- Features not available in embedded mode (WebSocket, HTTP, remote wait-for)
- Features under development (live queries, transactions, insert, upsert, export/import)
- Migration guide for moving to remote mode in the future

**Rationale:** Clear communication about embedded vs remote mode prevents user confusion and sets proper expectations. The migration guide provides a future path.

## Integration Points (if applicable)

### APIs/Endpoints
No API endpoints created (documentation task).

### Internal Dependencies
- Example scenarios import from `package:surrealdartb/surrealdartb.dart`
- CLI example imports all scenario files

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Limitations
1. **Insert/Upsert Documentation Limited**
   - Description: Insert and upsert operations are documented as "under testing"
   - Reason: These features are implemented but not yet validated by testing-engineer (Task Groups 5.1, 6.1, 7.1 pending)
   - Future Consideration: Full documentation will be added once features are validated

2. **No Live Query Example**
   - Description: Live query scenario not created
   - Reason: Live query infrastructure (Task Group 6.1) not yet implemented
   - Future Consideration: Will add comprehensive live query scenario once Task Group 6.1 is complete

3. **No Transaction Example**
   - Description: Transaction scenario not created
   - Reason: Transaction infrastructure (Task Group 7.1) not yet implemented
   - Future Consideration: Will add transaction scenario demonstrating callback pattern once Task Group 7.1 is complete

4. **No Export/Import Example**
   - Description: Export/import scenario not created
   - Reason: Export/import operations (Task Group 5.1) not yet implemented
   - Future Consideration: Will add scenario demonstrating backup/restore patterns once Task Group 5.1 is complete

## Performance Considerations

Documentation task - no performance implications.

## Security Considerations

Documentation emphasizes security best practices:
- Parameter usage to prevent SQL injection
- JWT token handling with `asInsecureToken()` naming to remind developers of security implications
- Authentication limitations in embedded mode clearly documented

## Dependencies for Other Tasks

None - This is the final task in the documentation phase.

## Notes

### Documentation Approach

The documentation strategy balances completeness with honesty about implementation status:

1. **Completed Features** (Task Groups 1-4): Fully documented with examples, use cases, and best practices
2. **Under Testing** (Task Groups 2.1, 2.2 for insert/upsert): Noted as available but not yet validated
3. **Not Implemented** (Task Groups 5.1, 6.1, 7.1): Clearly marked as "under development" with placeholders

This approach ensures users can immediately use validated features while understanding which capabilities are coming soon.

### Example Scenarios Quality

The new example scenarios follow the established pattern:
- Interactive CLI format matching existing scenarios
- Clear section headers and progress indicators
- Comprehensive error handling with try/finally
- Inline explanations of what's being demonstrated
- Warnings about embedded mode limitations where applicable
- Professional formatting with success/warning symbols

### README Structure

The updated README maintains clear organization:
- Quick Start section for immediate value
- Progressive disclosure (simple → advanced)
- Dedicated sections for each feature category
- "Embedded vs Remote Mode" section for clarity
- Troubleshooting section for common issues
- Platform support and requirements clearly stated

### Future Documentation Work

When Task Groups 5.1, 6.1, 7.1 are completed:
1. Remove "under testing" warnings for insert/upsert
2. Add comprehensive live query documentation and example scenario
3. Add transaction documentation and example scenario
4. Add export/import documentation and example scenario
5. Update "Features Currently Under Development" section
6. Generate full dartdoc HTML API reference

The current documentation provides a solid foundation that can be incrementally enhanced as remaining features are completed.
