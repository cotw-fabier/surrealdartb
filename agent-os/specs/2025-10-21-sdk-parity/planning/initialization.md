# Initial Spec Idea

## User's Initial Description
Implement complete 1:1 Rust:Dart SDK parity by wrapping all remaining Rust SDK features. Currently have a basic wrapper setup (visible in the example app), but need to implement all remaining methods and concepts from the Rust SDK to achieve full feature parity.

Context:
- Rust SDK documentation is located at: docs/doc-sdk-rust/
- Current implementation exists in: lib/src/ and example/
- The docs show extensive SDK methods (authenticate, connect, create, delete, export, get, import, insert, invalidate, query, run, select, select-live, set, signin, signup, unset, update, upsert, use, version, wait-for)
- Concepts include: authenticating users, concurrency, fetch, flexible typing, live queries, transactions, vector embeddings
- Current wrapper has basic functionality but needs all remaining features implemented
