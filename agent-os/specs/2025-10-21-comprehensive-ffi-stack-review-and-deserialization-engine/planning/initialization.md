# Initial Spec Idea

## User's Initial Description
**Feature Name:** "Comprehensive FFI Stack Review & Deserialization Engine"

**Description:**
Conduct a complete end-to-end review of the SurrealDB Dart FFI bindings implementation to ensure 100% functionality. The primary focus is fixing the broken deserialization layer where SurrealDB's internal type wrappers (Strand, Number, Thing, Object, Array) are being returned instead of clean JSON data. This causes all field values to appear as null in Dart.

Key objectives:
1. Audit the entire FFI stack (Rust FFI → Dart FFI → High-Level API → Isolate Architecture)
2. Fix the non-executing unwrapper function that should convert wrapped types to clean JSON
3. Build a robust deserialization engine that properly handles SurrealDB v2.x type serialization
4. Ensure all CRUD operations return correctly formatted data
5. Verify memory management, error handling, and async architecture are working correctly
6. Test the complete stack with real-world scenarios

This builds on the "Initial FFI Bindings Setup" spec but focuses on fixing critical deserialization bugs and ensuring the entire system is production-ready.
