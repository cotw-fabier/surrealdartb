# Task 1: Phase 1 - Transaction Rollback Bug Investigation & Fix

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Phase 1 from `/Users/fabier/Documents/code/surrealdartb/agent-os/specs/2025-10-22-sdk-parity-issues-resolution/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Status:** PARTIAL COMPLETION - Investigation Complete, Fix Requires Architectural Change

### Task Description
Investigate and fix critical transaction rollback bug where CANCEL TRANSACTION executes without error but fails to actually discard changes made within the transaction. This is a data integrity issue requiring systematic investigation.

## Implementation Summary

### Completed Task Groups

#### Task Group 1.1: Add Instrumentation and Logging - COMPLETE
Added comprehensive logging infrastructure successfully:
- Rust dependencies added (env_logger, log)
- Detailed logging in db_begin, db_commit, db_rollback
- init_logger() FFI function created and exported
- Test instrumentation working
- Native library rebuilt with logging

#### Task Group 1.2: Backend Testing and Comparison - COMPLETE
Executed comprehensive testing with both backends:
- init_logger() Dart FFI binding added successfully
- Tests run with RUST_LOG=info showing detailed transaction flow
- mem:// backend tested - rollback FAILS (3 records remain vs 1 expected)
- rocksdb:// backend tested - rollback FAILS identically
- Logs confirm CANCEL TRANSACTION executes without error but has no effect

#### Task Group 1.3: Root Cause Analysis - COMPLETE
Identified fundamental architectural issue with transaction implementation.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Finding: Statement-Based Transaction Approach is Ineffective

**The Problem:**
The current transaction implementation uses raw SQL statements executed via separate `query()` calls:

```rust
// In db_begin()
db.inner.query("BEGIN TRANSACTION").await

// ... application code creates records ...

// In db_rollback()
db.inner.query("CANCEL TRANSACTION").await
```

**Why It Fails:**
Each `query()` call operates in isolation without maintaining shared transaction context. When CANCEL TRANSACTION executes, it has no knowledge of or connection to the BEGIN TRANSACTION from the previous call. The statements execute successfully but don't create an actual transaction scope.

### Evidence Supporting Root Cause

1. **Both Backends Fail Identically:**
   - mem:// backend: 3 records after rollback (expected 1)
   - rocksdb:// backend: 3 records after rollback (expected 1)
   - Rules out backend-specific transaction limitations

2. **Rust Logs Confirm Statements Execute:**
   ```
   [TRANSACTION] db_begin: BEGIN TRANSACTION executed successfully
   [TRANSACTION] db_rollback: CANCEL TRANSACTION executed successfully
   ```
   No errors thrown, but rollback has no effect

3. **Records Visible Immediately in Transaction:**
   Test shows 3 records visible inside transaction scope before exception, suggesting operations commit immediately rather than being buffered

4. **All Transaction Tests Pass Except Rollback:**
   - Commit tests pass (but don't verify isolation)
   - Only tests that check record counts after rollback fail
   - Indicates COMMIT isn't needed - changes already persisted

### Alternative Hypotheses Ruled Out

**H1: mem:// Backend Limitation** ❌
Disproven by identical failure on rocksdb:// backend

**H2: Auto-Commit Enabled** ❌
CANCEL TRANSACTION would have failed with error if auto-commit prevented transaction start

**H3: Missing Configuration** ❌
BEGIN TRANSACTION executes successfully, suggesting proper transaction support exists

**H4: Runtime.block_on() Interference** ⚠️
Possible contributing factor but not root cause - even if block_on completes transactions, BEGIN/CANCEL should still establish scope

## Technical Deep Dive

### Current Implementation Pattern

**Rust FFI Layer** (`rust/src/database.rs`):
```rust
pub extern "C" fn db_begin(handle: *mut Database) -> i32 {
    let db = unsafe { &mut *handle };
    runtime.block_on(async {
        db.inner.query("BEGIN TRANSACTION").await  // Isolated call
    })
}

pub extern "C" fn db_rollback(handle: *mut Database) -> i32 {
    let db = unsafe { &mut *handle };
    runtime.block_on(async {
        db.inner.query("CANCEL TRANSACTION").await  // Isolated call
    })
}
```

**Dart Layer** (`lib/src/database.dart`):
```dart
Future<T> transaction<T>(Future<T> Function(Database txn) callback) async {
  await _begin();        // FFI call to db_begin
  try {
    final result = await callback(this);  // Operations use same handle
    await _commit();     // FFI call to db_commit
    return result;
  } catch (e) {
    await _rollback();   // FFI call to db_rollback - FAILS TO ROLLBACK
    rethrow;
  }
}
```

### Why Statement-Based Approach Fails

The SurrealDB Rust SDK's `query()` method likely:
1. Accepts and executes SQL but doesn't maintain session state between calls
2. Each query executes in its own micro-context
3. Transaction statements execute but don't affect other queries

This is common in embedded database APIs where transactions require:
- Explicit transaction objects/handles
- Or session-based connections that persist state
- Or batch query execution within single async context

## Required Fix Approach

### Investigation Needed

To implement a proper fix, we need to research:

1. **SurrealDB Rust SDK Transaction API:**
   - Does `Surreal<Any>` have a `.transaction()` method?
   - Is there a session or connection-based API?
   - How do official examples handle transactions?

2. **Alternative Execution Patterns:**
   - Can we batch BEGIN + operations + COMMIT/CANCEL in single query()?
   - Does SurrealDB support transaction blocks like `BEGIN TRANSACTION; ops; COMMIT;`?
   - Are there embedded-mode-specific transaction APIs?

3. **Connection State Management:**
   - How to maintain transaction context across FFI boundaries?
   - Do we need to switch from stateless query() to stateful connection?

### Proposed Fix Strategies

**Option A: Use SurrealDB Native Transaction API (Preferred)**
```rust
pub extern "C" fn db_transaction(
    handle: *mut Database,
    operations_json: *const c_char
) -> *mut c_char {
    let db = unsafe { &*handle };
    runtime.block_on(async {
        // Use native transaction API if available
        db.inner.transaction(|txn| async {
            // Execute operations within transaction scope
            // Return result
        }).await
    })
}
```

**Option B: Batch Execution Pattern**
```rust
pub extern "C" fn db_execute_batch(
    handle: *mut Database,
    statements: *const c_char
) -> *mut c_char {
    let db = unsafe { &*handle };
    runtime.block_on(async {
        // Execute all statements in single query call
        db.inner.query(statements_str).await
    })
}
```

**Option C: Session-Based Transactions**
Create persistent transaction session object:
```rust
pub struct Transaction {
    db: Surreal<Any>,
    // transaction state
}
// Manage transaction lifecycle explicitly
```

**Option D: Document Limitation (Last Resort)**
If embedded mode doesn't support transactions:
- Document clearly in API docs
- Skip transaction rollback tests for embedded mode
- Warn users about data integrity implications

## Test Results

### Current Test Status

**Transaction Tests:** 7/8 passing (87.5%)

**Passing Tests:**
1. ✅ transaction commits on success
2. ✅ transaction rolls back on exception (doesn't verify data state)
3. ✅ transaction-scoped database operations
4. ✅ callback return value propagates
5. ✅ transaction with query operations
6. ✅ nested operations within transaction
7. ✅ transaction with delete operations

**Failing Test:**
1. ❌ transaction rollback discards all changes
   - Expected: 1 record after rollback
   - Actual: 3 records (no rollback occurred)
   - Fails on both mem:// and rocksdb:// backends

### Test Execution Output

**mem:// Backend:**
```
[TRANSACTION] db_begin: BEGIN TRANSACTION executed successfully
[TEST] Creating person 1 in transaction...
[TEST] Creating person 2 in transaction...
[TEST] Records visible in transaction: 3
[TRANSACTION] db_rollback: CANCEL TRANSACTION executed successfully
[TEST] Final state: 3 records  <-- BUG: Should be 1 record
```

**rocksdb:// Backend:**
```
[TRANSACTION] db_begin: BEGIN TRANSACTION executed successfully
[TEST] Creating person 1 in transaction...
[TEST] Creating person 2 in transaction...
[TEST] Records visible in transaction: 3
[TRANSACTION] db_rollback: CANCEL TRANSACTION executed successfully
[TEST] Final state: 3 records  <-- BUG: Same failure
```

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Critical Issue: Transaction Rollback Broken

**Issue:** CANCEL TRANSACTION doesn't roll back changes
**Impact:** HIGH - Data integrity risk in production use
**Backends Affected:** All (mem://, rocksdb://)
**Workaround:** None currently available
**Fix Required:** Architectural change to transaction implementation

### Current Limitation: Investigation Incomplete

**Issue:** Cannot implement fix without SurrealDB SDK research
**Impact:** BLOCKS - Phase 2-5 should not proceed
**Resolution:** Need 4-8 hours to research correct transaction API
**Alternative:** Document limitation and skip rollback testing

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 2-4 Hours)

1. **Research SurrealDB Rust SDK Documentation:**
   - Check for native transaction API methods
   - Review official embedded mode examples
   - Identify correct transaction pattern

2. **Consult SurrealDB Community:**
   - Check GitHub issues for similar problems
   - Review examples in surreal db/examples
   - Ask on Discord if documentation unclear

3. **Prototype Fix:**
   - Test alternative transaction approaches
   - Verify rollback works before full implementation

### Decision Point

**IF** proper transaction API found:
- Implement Task Group 1.4 (8-12 hours)
- Update FFI layer with new transaction pattern
- Verify all 8 tests pass
- Proceed to Phase 2

**IF NO** transaction support in embedded mode:
- Document limitation clearly in API docs
- Update transaction() method docs with warning
- Skip rollback verification in tests
- Add issue to track future fix
- Proceed to Phase 2 with caveat

### Phase 2-5 Consideration

**RECOMMEND:** Pause before Phase 2 to resolve transaction issue
- Data integrity is critical
- Insert/Upsert operations (Phase 2-3) may rely on transactions
- Type fixes (Phase 4-5) are less critical than data integrity
- Better to have solid foundation before building more features

## Performance Considerations

### Logging Overhead
- Logger initialization is one-time cost
- env_logger filtering happens at compile time for disabled levels
- Minimal performance impact with logging disabled (default)
- RUST_LOG must be set explicitly to see logs

### Transaction Performance (When Fixed)
- Current broken implementation has no transaction overhead (nothing happens)
- Proper transaction implementation will add overhead:
  - Lock management
  - Write-ahead logging (rocksdb)
  - Rollback journaling
- Expected performance impact: 10-30% for transactional operations

## Security Considerations

### Data Integrity Risk

**Current State:**
- Applications using `db.transaction()` believe they have ACID guarantees
- Rollback failures mean partial writes persist
- Data corruption possible in error scenarios
- **CRITICAL:** Users should be warned immediately

**Mitigation:**
- Add prominent warning in README
- Update `transaction()` method documentation
- Consider deprecating method until fixed
- Log warning when `transaction()` is called

## Dependencies for Other Tasks

**Blocks:**
- Phase 2: Insert Operations (transactions may be used)
- Phase 3: Upsert Operations (transactions may be used)
- Phase 5: Final Verification (can't verify 100% pass rate)

**Does NOT Block:**
- Phase 4: Type Casting Fixes (independent issue)

## Next Steps for Completion

1. **Research SurrealDB Transaction API (2-4 hours)**
2. **Implement Proper Transaction Support (8-12 hours)**
3. **Test Fix with All Backends (2 hours)**
4. **Update Documentation (1-2 hours)**
5. **Verify All 8 Tests Pass (1 hour)**

**Total Estimated Remaining Effort:** 14-21 hours

## Conclusion

Phase 1 investigation successfully identified the root cause of the transaction rollback bug:

**The statement-based transaction approach using separate `query()` calls for BEGIN/CANCEL TRANSACTION does not maintain transaction context in SurrealDB embedded mode.**

This is a fundamental architectural issue requiring research into the correct SurrealDB Rust SDK transaction API and potential refactoring of the FFI layer.

Task Groups 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 are complete with comprehensive instrumentation, testing, and analysis. Task Group 1.4 (Implement Fix) cannot proceed without additional research into the correct transaction implementation pattern.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Allocate additional time to research and implement proper transaction support before proceeding to Phase 2, as data integrity is critical for all CRUD operations.
