# Phase 1: Transaction Rollback Bug Investigation (IN PROGRESS)

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Phase 1 from `/Users/fabier/Documents/code/surrealdartb/agent-os/specs/2025-10-22-sdk-parity-issues-resolution/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Status:** IN PROGRESS - Task Groups 1.1 and 1.2 Complete

### Task Description
Investigate and fix critical transaction rollback bug where CANCEL TRANSACTION executes without error but fails to actually discard changes made within the transaction. This is a data integrity issue requiring systematic investigation.

## Implementation Summary (Tasks 1.1 and 1.2)

### Task Group 1.1: Add Instrumentation and Logging - COMPLETE

Added comprehensive logging infrastructure to trace transaction lifecycle:

1. **Rust Dependencies**: Added `env_logger` and `log` crates to `/Users/fabier/Documents/code/surrealdartb/rust/Cargo.toml`

2. **Rust Logging**: Added detailed logging to transaction functions in `/Users/fabier/Documents/code/surrealdartb/rust/src/database.rs`:
   - `db_begin()`: Logs transaction start, query execution, and response
   - `db_commit()`: Logs commit initiation, query execution, and response
   - `db_rollback()`: Logs rollback initiation, CANCEL TRANSACTION execution, and response details
   - All functions use `[TRANSACTION]` prefix for easy filtering
   - Log levels: INFO for lifecycle events, DEBUG for detailed responses, ERROR for failures

3. **Logger Initialization**: Added `init_logger()` FFI function in `/Users/fabier/Documents/code/surrealdartb/rust/src/lib.rs` to enable env_logger

4. **Test Instrumentation**: Enhanced `/Users/fabier/Documents/code/surrealdartb/test/transaction_test.dart` with print statements at key points:
   - Test setup/teardown logging
   - Transaction entry/exit logging
   - Record creation logging with actual data
   - State verification logging before and after operations
   - Clear test progress markers

5. **Native Library Rebuild**: Successfully rebuilt Rust library with logging enabled at `/Users/fabier/Documents/code/surrealdartb/rust/target/release/libsurrealdartb_bindings.dylib` (15M, Oct 22 09:31)

### Task Group 1.2: Backend Testing and Comparison - COMPLETE

Executed failing test with instrumentation to gather evidence:

**Test Execution Command:**
```bash
RUST_LOG=info dart test test/transaction_test.dart --name "transaction rollback discards all changes"
```

**Key Findings from Test Output:**

1. **Transaction Flow**:
   - Initial state: 1 record (Original person with age 50)
   - Created person 1 in transaction: "Should Rollback 1" with age 51
   - Created person 2 in transaction: "Should Rollback 2" with age 52
   - Records visible in transaction: 3 records (all three visible)
   - Exception thrown to trigger rollback
   - EXPECTED final state: 1 record (only Original)
   - ACTUAL final state: 3 records (all three still exist)

2. **Evidence of Rollback Failure**:
```
[TEST] Initial state: 1 records
[TEST] Initial records: [{age: 50, id: person:1kfj2qh7sgq13enxi8zh, name: Original}]
[TEST] Creating person 1 in transaction...
[TEST] Created person 1: {age: 51, id: person:tsrtkrcu06c6bsvpmo61, name: Should Rollback 1}
[TEST] Creating person 2 in transaction...
[TEST] Created person 2: {age: 52, id: person:jzn5shvj493ufyjla616, name: Should Rollback 2}
[TEST] Checking state before exception...
[TEST] Records visible in transaction: 3
[TEST] Records: [{age: 50, id: person:1kfj2qh7sgq13enxi8zh, name: Original},
                 {age: 52, id: person:jzn5shvj493ufyjla616, name: Should Rollback 2},
                 {age: 51, id: person:tsrtkrcu06c6bsvpmo61, name: Should Rollback 1}]
[TEST] Throwing exception to trigger rollback...
[TEST] Caught expected exception: Exception: Rollback test
[TEST] Verifying rollback completed...
[TEST] Final state: 3 records
[TEST] Final records: [{age: 50, id: person:1kfj2qh7sgq13enxi8zh, name: Original},
                       {age: 52, id: person:jzn5shvj493ufyjla616, name: Should Rollback 2},
                       {age: 51, id: person:tsrtkrcu06c6bsvpmo61, name: Should Rollback 1}]

Expected: an object with length of <1>
  Actual: has length of <3>
```

3. **Critical Observation**:
   - No Rust-level logs appeared in output despite RUST_LOG=info being set
   - This indicates `env_logger` initialization is required before any logging occurs
   - Need to call `init_logger()` FFI function from Dart before database operations

4. **Other Transaction Tests**:
   - "transaction commits on success" - PASSING
   - "transaction rolls back on exception" - PASSING (but doesn't verify data state properly)
   - "transaction-scoped database operations" - PASSING
   - "callback return value propagates" - PASSING
   - "transaction with query operations" - PASSING
   - "nested operations within transaction" - PASSING
   - "transaction with delete operations" - PASSING

5. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - Tests that don't verify rollback by checking record counts pass
   - Only test that explicitly counts records after rollback fails
   - This suggests CANCEL TRANSACTION executes without error but has no effect

## Current Hypothesis

Based on investigation so far:

### Primary Hypothesis: SurrealDB mem:// Backend Transaction Limitations

**Evidence Supporting:**
1. CANCEL TRANSACTION executes without error (no exception thrown from Rust)
2. Changes are not discarded (3 records remain instead of 1)
3. mem:// storage backend may have limited transaction support
4. In-memory databases sometimes use simplified transaction models

**Evidence Needed:**
1. Test with rocksdb:// backend to compare behavior (Task Group 1.2 continuation)
2. Review SurrealDB documentation for mem:// backend transaction support
3. Check if explicit transaction isolation configuration is required

### Alternative Hypotheses

**H2: Auto-commit Behavior**
- Each CREATE query may be committing immediately
- BEGIN TRANSACTION may not be properly disabling auto-commit
- Would explain why CANCEL TRANSACTION has no effect

**H3: Runtime.block_on() Interference**
- The blocking of async operations may be completing transactions prematurely
- Transaction state might not persist across multiple block_on() calls
- Each FFI call might be starting a new transaction context

**H4: Missing Transaction Configuration**
- CANCEL TRANSACTION might require additional parameters
- Transaction isolation level might need explicit setting
- Connection-level transaction settings might be needed

## Next Steps (Tasks 1.2 continuation, 1.3, 1.4)

### Task 1.2 Continuation: Test with rocksdb:// backend
1. Add Dart FFI binding for init_logger()
2. Call init_logger() before database operations in tests
3. Re-run failing test with mem:// backend to capture Rust logs
4. Modify test to use rocksdb:// backend temporarily
5. Run same test with rocksdb:// and compare results
6. Document behavioral differences between backends

### Task 1.3: Root Cause Analysis
1. Review SurrealDB documentation for transaction semantics
2. Analyze log outputs to identify root cause
3. Check if BEGIN TRANSACTION properly initiates transaction mode
4. Verify transaction state persistence across FFI calls
5. Test manual SQL transaction workflow
6. Create detailed root cause report

### Task 1.4: Implement Fix
1. Based on root cause, implement targeted fix
2. Modify Rust FFI functions as needed
3. Update Dart transaction() method if required
4. Verify fix with both mem:// and rocksdb:// backends
5. Ensure all 8 transaction tests pass
6. Document fix approach and rationale

## Technical Notes

### Logging Configuration

**Rust Log Levels:**
- `RUST_LOG=error` - Only errors
- `RUST_LOG=warn` - Warnings and errors
- `RUST_LOG=info` - Info, warnings, and errors (recommended for investigation)
- `RUST_LOG=debug` - Debug plus above (includes detailed response data)
- `RUST_LOG=trace` - All logs including trace level

**Current Limitation:**
env_logger must be explicitly initialized by calling `init_logger()` from Dart before any logging occurs. This requires:
1. Adding typedef to native_types.dart
2. Adding @Native binding to bindings.dart
3. Calling in Database.connect() or test setUp()

### Memory Backend Considerations

The mem:// storage backend is:
- Fast and convenient for testing
- May have simplified or incomplete transaction support
- Typically used for development, not production
- Should be compared against persistent backends like rocksdb://

### Transaction Lifecycle

Current implementation:
1. `db_begin()` executes "BEGIN TRANSACTION" statement
2. Operations execute on same database handle
3. `db_rollback()` executes "CANCEL TRANSACTION" statement
4. No explicit transaction object or context management

This "statement-based" approach relies on SurrealDB maintaining transaction state on the connection. If the backend doesn't support this, rollback will fail.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Backend Rust Integration
- Used `log` crate for structured logging (standard Rust logging facade)
- Used `env_logger` for configuration via environment variables
- All FFI functions maintain panic safety with `std::panic::catch_unwind`
- Logger initialization uses `std::sync::Once` for thread safety
- Follows existing error handling patterns with `set_last_error()`

### Global Coding Style
- Descriptive variable names in logging statements
- Clear log message structure with `[TRANSACTION]` prefix
- Comprehensive documentation for `init_logger()` FFI function
- Test logging follows clear, descriptive pattern

### Global Error Handling
- Logging preserves error context from SurrealDB
- Debug logs include response details for troubleshooting
- Error logs clearly identify failure points
- Test output shows exception handling flow

## Known Issues

1. **Rust Logs Not Appearing**: env_logger requires explicit initialization before logging occurs. Need to complete FFI binding for `init_logger()` and call it from Dart.

2. **Test Still Failing**: The rollback test fails because CANCEL TRANSACTION doesn't discard changes. This is the core issue being investigated.

3. **Incomplete Comparison**: Haven't yet tested with rocksdb:// backend due to needing logger initialization first. Will complete in next iteration.

## Conclusion (Partial)

Task Groups 1.1 and 1.2 have provided crucial evidence about the transaction rollback bug:

1. **Instrumentation is in place** with comprehensive Rust and Dart logging
2. **Bug is confirmed** - test output clearly shows 3 records after rollback instead of 1
3. **CANCEL TRANSACTION executes** - no error is thrown from the Rust layer
4. **Changes are not discarded** - records created in transaction persist after rollback
5. **Logger initialization pending** - need to add FFI binding to see Rust-level logs

The investigation strongly suggests the issue is with how SurrealDB's mem:// backend handles transactions, but definitive confirmation requires:
- Completing logger FFI binding
- Capturing Rust-level logs showing CANCEL TRANSACTION execution
- Testing with rocksdb:// backend for comparison
- Reviewing SurrealDB documentation for backend-specific transaction behavior

**Next Implementation Session:** Complete Task Group 1.2 by adding init_logger() binding, capturing Rust logs, and testing with rocksdb:// backend.
