# Initial Spec Idea

## User's Initial Description

"Resolve critical issues and complete remaining features from the SurrealDB Dart SDK Parity implementation. This includes:

1. **CRITICAL - Fix Transaction Rollback Bug**: Transaction rollback is not properly discarding changes (data integrity issue)

2. **HIGH - Resolve Insert/Upsert Implementation Gap**: Tests exist but methods (insertContent, insertRelation, upsertContent, upsertMerge, upsertPatch) are missing from Database class

3. **HIGH - Clarify Export/Import Status**: Implementation reports claim completion but methods appear to be missing

4. **MEDIUM - Fix Type Casting Issues**: Parameter and integration tests have type mismatch issues (6/8 and 9/15 passing)

5. **MEDIUM - Complete Live Queries**: Currently 30% complete with design done, needs full implementation (7-10 days estimated)

**Context from Previous Spec:**

The previous spec (2025-10-21-sdk-parity) achieved:
- ‚úÖ Core type system (RecordId, Datetime, SurrealDuration, PatchOp) - 100% complete
- ‚úÖ Authentication system - 100% complete
- ‚úÖ Function execution - 100% complete
- ‚úÖ Basic CRUD operations - Working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Transactions - 88% working (rollback bug)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Parameters - 75% working (type issues)
- ‚ùå Insert/Upsert - Implementation unclear
- ‚ùå Export/Import - Implementation unclear
- üîÑ Live Queries - 30% complete

**Overall Status:** 40% production ready, 86% test pass rate (119/139 tests passing)

**Goal:** Address critical issues and complete remaining features to achieve 100% production readiness."
