### Phase 1: Transaction Rollback Bug Investigation & Fix (CRITICAL - Days 1-2)

**DEPENDENCIES:** None - MUST complete before any other phase
**PRIORITY:** CRITICAL - Data integrity risk

---

#### Task Group 1.1: Add Instrumentation and Logging

#### Task Group 1.2: Backend Testing and Comparison
**Assigned Implementer:** api-engineer
**Dependencies:** Task Group 1.1
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours (Day 1 Afternoon)
**STATUS:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS (60% complete)

#### Task Group 1.2: Backend Testing and Comparison
**Assigned Implementer:** api-engineer
**Dependencies:** Task Group 1.1
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours (Day 1 Afternoon)
**STATUS:** ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] 1.2.0 Test transaction rollback with multiple backends
  - [x] 1.2.1 Test with mem:// backend (current failing case)
    - Run existing transaction_test.dart with mem:// backend
    - Capture detailed logs from Task Group 1.1
    - Document specific behavior (records not rolled back)
    - Verify CANCEL TRANSACTION executes without error
  - [x] 1.2.2 Test with rocksdb:// backend
    - Created temporary test with rocksdb:// backend
    - Executed "transaction rollback discards all changes" test

    - **FINDING:** Identical failure - rollback doesn't work on rocksdb:// either
  - [x] 1.2.3 Compare transaction support across backends
    - Documented that BOTH backends fail identically
    - Ruled out mem:// backend limitation
    - Identified as fundamental implementation issue not backend-specific
  - [x] 1.2.4 Analyze log outputs from both backends
    - Compared query execution traces
    - Both show "CANCEL TRANSACTION executed successfully"
    - No differences in transaction behavior between backends
    - Changes persist despite successful CANCEL TRANSACTION execution
  - [x] 1.2.5 Document findings in investigation report
    - Created comprehensive investigation report
    - Included log excerpts from both backends

---

#### Task Group 1.3: Root Cause Analysis
**Assigned Implementer:** api-engineer
**Dependencies:** Task Group 1.2
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours (Day 2 Morning)
**STATUS:** ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] 1.3.0 Identify root cause of rollback failure
  - [x] 1.3.1 Review SurrealDB embedded mode transaction behavior
    - CANCEL TRANSACTION syntax is correct (logs confirm execution)
    - No parameters or options missing
    - Embedded mode uses same transaction statements as server mode
    - Issue is with HOW statements are executed not WHAT statements are used
  - [x] 1.3.2 Verify transaction state maintenance across FFI
    - **FINDING:** Transaction state is NOT preserved across query() calls
    - Each db.inner.query() call operates in isolation
    - BEGIN TRANSACTION and CANCEL TRANSACTION execute but don't share context
    - Database handle is maintained but query() doesn't preserve session state
  - [x] 1.3.3 Test for auto-commit behavior
    - Changes are immediately visible (not buffered)
    - Records created in transaction persist after CANCEL TRANSACTION
    - Suggests implicit commit after each operation
    - Not traditional auto-commit (BEGIN executes successfully)
  - [x] 1.3.4 Compare with SurrealDB patterns
    - Current implementation uses statement-based approach
    - Each FFI call executes separate query() call
    - Need to research if SurrealDB Rust SDK has native transaction API
    - May require batch execution or session-based transactions
  - [x] 1.3.5 Test alternative approaches (analysis only)
    - Identified that single query() call might need to contain all operations
    - Or SurrealDB SDK may have .transaction() method we're not using
    - Or need session/connection-based approach instead of isolated queries
  - [x] 1.3.6 Document root cause findings
    - Created detailed analysis in implementation report
    - Included supporting evidence from both backends
    - Proposed fix approaches requiring SurrealDB SDK research
    - Identified architectural issue with current FFI design

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Root cause clearly identified: Statement-based transaction API doesn't maintain context
- ✅ Supporting evidence from tests and logs provided (both backends tested)
- ✅ Specific fix approaches proposed (4 options documented)
- ✅ SurrealDB embedded mode behavior documented
- ✅ Clear understanding of why rollback fails (isolated query() calls)

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:**
The current implementation executes BEGIN TRANSACTION and CANCEL TRANSACTION as separate `db.inner.query()` calls. Each query() call operates in isolation without maintaining shared transaction context. When CANCEL TRANSACTION executes, it has no knowledge of the BEGIN TRANSACTION from the previous call. The statements execute successfully but don't create an actual transaction scope.

## Implementation Notes

### Sequential Execution Philosophy

This spec REQUIRES sequential execution. Each phase must complete before the next begins:
1. **Phase 1 is BLOCKING** - Transaction rollback bug is a data integrity issue that must be fixed first
2. **Phase 2 and 3 can proceed** - Insert and upsert reimplementation after Phase 1
3. **Phase 4 depends on 1-3** - Type casting fixes require all operations implemented first
4. **Phase 5 is final** - Comprehensive verification after all fixes complete

**Do NOT start Phase 2 until Phase 1 is 100% complete with all tests passing.**

### Test Philosophy for This Spec

Unlike the original SDK parity spec, this is a **BUG FIX** spec, so testing approach differs:

1. **No new test writing** - Tests already exist from previous implementation
2. **Focus on test pass rates** - Goal is to get existing tests passing
3. **Verify against implementation reports** - Ensure code matches previous working implementations exactly
4. **Investigation required** - Phase 1 requires debugging, not just implementation

### FFI Pattern Consistency

All reimplemented code MUST follow existing FFI patterns exactly:
- Rust: panic::catch_unwind, set_last_error, Box::into_raw/from_raw
- Dart: Future(() {...}), try/finally cleanup, _processResponse()
- No deviations from established patterns

### Error Handling Pattern

All methods must:
1. Validate inputs before FFI calls
2. Use try/finally for all pointer cleanup
3. Throw appropriate exceptions (ArgumentError for validation, QueryException for DB errors)
4. Preserve error context from native layer

### Memory Management

Critical: This spec fixes previously working code that had proper memory management. Do NOT introduce memory leaks:
- All malloc.free() calls in finally blocks
- All Box::into_raw has corresponding Box::from_raw
- All pointers cleaned up even on error paths

## Critical Reminders

### For Phase 1 (Transaction Bug)

1. **Investigation First** - Don't jump to solutions, instrument and analyze
2. **Test Both Backends** - mem:// and rocksdb:// may behave differently
3. **Document Root Cause** - Future maintainers need to understand the fix
4. **Data Integrity** - This is the most critical bug, take time to fix it right

### For Phases 2 and 3 (Insert/Upsert)

1. **Follow Reports Exactly** - Implementation reports provide complete specification
2. **No Creativity** - Reimplement existing working code, don't improve or change
3. **Known Limitations OK** - Insert 6/8 pass rate is acceptable per original spec
4. **Test Before Proceeding** - Verify tests pass before moving to next phase

### For Phase 4 (Type Casting)

1. **Response Structure** - Understand [[{record}]] vs [{record}] unwrapping
2. **Consistency** - All operations should handle types the same way
3. **Test Assertions** - Fix tests if response types are actually correct
4. **Document Patterns** - Help future implementers understand type handling

### For Phase 5 (Verification)

1. **No New Features** - This is verification only, no additional implementation
2. **100% Target** - All in-scope tests must pass
3. **No Regressions** - Verify 119 baseline tests still pass
4. **Memory Safety** - Stress test to ensure no leaks introduced
