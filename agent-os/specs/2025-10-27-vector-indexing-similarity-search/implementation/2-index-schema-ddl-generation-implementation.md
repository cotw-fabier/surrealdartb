# Task 2: Index Schema and DDL Generation

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #2 from `C:\Users\fabie\Documents\surrealdartb\agent-os\specs\2025-10-27-vector-indexing-similarity-search\tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** database-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** Complete

### Task Description
Implement schema integration for vector indexes, including extending TableStructure to support vector indexes, creating DDL generation capabilities for vector indexes, integrating with the migration workflow, and implementing index management operations (create, drop, rebuild).

## Implementation Summary
Successfully integrated vector indexes into the existing schema system by extending TableStructure with an optional `vectorIndexes` field, enhancing DdlGenerator with vector index DDL generation methods, and creating an IndexManager utility class for index lifecycle operations. The implementation maintains full backward compatibility with the existing schema system while adding comprehensive support for vector similarity search indexes with all distance metrics (Euclidean, Cosine, Manhattan, Minkowski) and index types (MTREE, HNSW).

The implementation follows the existing patterns from FieldDefinition and DdlGenerator, ensuring consistency with the codebase architecture. Vector indexes are properly ordered in the DDL generation workflow (after tables and fields), and the IndexManager provides a clean API for create, drop, and rebuild operations with proper error handling.

All 8 tests written for this task group pass successfully, validating that vector indexes integrate seamlessly with TableStructure, DDL statements are generated correctly, migration workflow ordering is preserved, and rebuild operations function as expected.

## Key Implementation Details

### TableStructure Extension
**Location:** `C:\Users\fabie\Documents\surrealdartb\lib\src\schema\table_structure.dart`

Extended the TableStructure class to include an optional `vectorIndexes` field:

```dart
class TableStructure {
  TableStructure(this.tableName, this.fields, {this.vectorIndexes}) {
    // ... existing validation
  }

  final String tableName;
  final Map<String, FieldDefinition> fields;

  /// Optional list of vector index definitions.
  List<IndexDefinition>? vectorIndexes;
}
```

**Rationale:** Made the field optional and mutable to maintain full backward compatibility with existing code. Existing TableStructure instantiations continue to work without modification, while new code can optionally add vector indexes. The field can be set after construction, allowing flexibility in schema definition.

### DdlGenerator Vector Index Support
**Location:** `C:\Users\fabie\Documents\surrealdartb\lib\src\schema\ddl_generator.dart`

Added four new methods to DdlGenerator for vector index operations:

1. **generateVectorIndexDDL(TableStructure table)**: Generates DEFINE INDEX statements for all vector indexes in a table
2. **generateFullTableDDL(TableStructure table)**: Generates complete DDL including table, fields, regular indexes, and vector indexes in correct order
3. **generateRemoveVectorIndex(String tableName, String indexName)**: Generates REMOVE INDEX statement for vector indexes
4. **generateRebuildVectorIndex(IndexDefinition index)**: Generates drop + recreate statements for index rebuild

Extended `generateFromDiff()` to handle vector indexes in the migration workflow, ensuring they are created after tables and fields.

**Rationale:** This approach extends the existing DdlGenerator pattern rather than creating a separate IndexDdlGenerator, maintaining consistency with the codebase architecture. The methods integrate seamlessly with existing DDL generation workflows and ensure proper statement ordering (tables -> fields -> regular indexes -> vector indexes).

### IndexManager Utility
**Location:** `C:\Users\fabie\Documents\surrealdartb\lib\src\schema\index_manager.dart`

Created a dedicated IndexManager class for index lifecycle operations:

```dart
class IndexManager {
  IndexManager(this.db);
  final Database db;

  Future<void> createIndex(IndexDefinition index) async { ... }
  Future<void> dropIndex(String tableName, String indexName) async { ... }
  Future<void> rebuildIndex(IndexDefinition index) async { ... }
  Future<void> createIndexes(List<IndexDefinition> indexes) async { ... }
  Future<void> dropIndexes(Map<String, List<String>> indexes) async { ... }
}
```

**Rationale:** Separating index management into a dedicated utility class keeps the Database class clean and focused, following the single responsibility principle. IndexManager provides a clear, type-safe API for all index operations with comprehensive error handling. The class can be easily extended in the future with additional index management capabilities.

### Migration Workflow Integration
**Location:** `C:\Users\fabie\Documents\surrealdartb\lib\src\schema\ddl_generator.dart` (generateFromDiff method)

Modified the DDL generation workflow to include vector indexes in the correct order:

**Phase 1**: Create new tables
- DEFINE TABLE
- DEFINE FIELD (all fields)
- DEFINE INDEX (regular indexes)
- DEFINE INDEX (vector indexes) <- New

**Phase 4**: Add new indexes to existing tables
- DEFINE INDEX (regular indexes)
- Vector indexes for new tables handled in Phase 1

**Phase 5-7**: Remove indexes, fields, and tables (unchanged)

**Rationale:** Vector indexes must be created after all fields exist to ensure the indexed field is available. Integrating vector indexes into the existing migration workflow ensures they are handled correctly during schema evolution while maintaining the dependency order.

## Database Changes

### Migrations
No new migration files created - this implementation extends the schema system to support vector index definitions. Migrations will be generated automatically when users define vector indexes in their TableStructure definitions.

### Schema Impact
The schema system now supports vector indexes as first-class citizens. When a TableStructure includes vectorIndexes, the DDL generation automatically produces:

1. DEFINE INDEX statements with vector-specific parameters (DISTANCE, DIMENSION, M, EFC, CAPACITY)
2. REMOVE INDEX statements for index cleanup
3. Rebuild sequences (REMOVE + DEFINE) for index reconstruction

Example generated DDL:
```sql
DEFINE INDEX idx_embedding ON documents FIELDS embedding MTREE DISTANCE COSINE DIMENSION 768 CAPACITY 40
```

## Dependencies

### New Dependencies Added
None - implementation uses existing dependencies.

### Configuration Changes
None required.

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
- `C:\Users\fabie\Documents\surrealdartb\test\vector_index_schema_integration_test.dart` - Created comprehensive test suite with 8 focused tests.

### Test Coverage

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Global Coding Style (agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md)
**How Implementation Complies:**
Followed Dart naming conventions (camelCase for methods, PascalCase for classes), maintained consistent indentation and formatting throughout, used meaningful descriptive names (generateVectorIndexDDL, rebuildIndex, IndexManager), and included comprehensive documentation comments for all public APIs.

### Global Commenting Standards (agent-os/standards/global/commenting.md)
**How Implementation Complies:**
Added detailed doc comments for all new classes and methods following Dart conventions with /// syntax, included usage examples in documentation, documented parameters and return values, and explained rationale for design decisions in implementation comments.

### Global Conventions (agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md)
**How Implementation Complies:**
Maintained backward compatibility by making vectorIndexes optional, followed existing patterns from FieldDefinition and DdlGenerator, used const constructors where appropriate, and ensured consistent error handling patterns with DatabaseException wrapping.

### Global Error Handling (agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md)
**How Implementation Complies:**
IndexManager wraps all database exceptions with descriptive error messages including context (index name, table name), provides clear error messages for validation failures, and ensures resources are properly cleaned up. Error handling follows existing patterns in the codebase.

### Backend Async Patterns (agent-os/standards/backend/async-patterns.md)
**How Implementation Complies:**
All index management methods are properly async (Future-returning), use await for database operations, and maintain the existing async patterns used in the Database class. No blocking operations introduced.

### Test Writing Standards (agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md)
**How Implementation Complies:**
Tests follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert), use descriptive test names explaining what is being tested, focus on behavior rather than implementation details, and test both happy paths and edge cases. Tests are isolated and do not depend on execution order.

**Deviations:** None

## Integration Points

### APIs/Endpoints
No external API endpoints - this is internal schema system enhancement.

### Internal Dependencies
- **IndexDefinition** (from Task Group 1): Used throughout for index configuration
- **DdlGenerator**: Extended to support vector index DDL generation
- **TableStructure**: Extended to hold vector index definitions
- **Database.queryQL()**: Used by IndexManager to execute DDL statements

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified during implementation and testing.

### Limitations
1. **No Automatic Index Updates**
   - Description: Indexes must be manually rebuilt when data changes significantly
   - Reason: SurrealDB does not support automatic index rebuilding on data updates
   - Future Consideration: Could add monitoring to suggest when rebuilds are needed

2. **Sequential Index Operations**
   - Description: Batch index operations execute sequentially, not in parallel
   - Reason: SurrealDB DDL statements must be executed in sequence
   - Future Consideration: Could explore parallel execution for independent indexes on different tables

## Performance Considerations
DDL generation is lightweight and has negligible performance impact. Index creation via IndexManager executes asynchronously and follows SurrealDB's native performance characteristics. The implementation adds no significant overhead to existing schema operations.

## Security Considerations
No security implications - DDL generation and index management follow existing security patterns in the Database class. All user input (index definitions) is validated before DDL generation to prevent SQL injection.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
**Task Group 3 (Similarity Search API)** depends on this implementation:
- IndexManager provides the infrastructure for creating indexes that the search API will use
- DdlGenerator ensures indexes are properly created during migrations
- TableStructure integration enables defining indexes alongside table schemas

## Notes
This implementation successfully integrates vector indexes into the existing schema system while maintaining full backward compatibility. The design follows existing patterns (FieldDefinition, DdlGenerator) which made integration straightforward and consistent with the codebase architecture.

The separation of concerns between schema definition (TableStructure), DDL generation (DdlGenerator), and index operations (IndexManager) creates a clean, maintainable architecture that can be easily extended in the future.

All acceptance criteria from the task specification have been met:
- 8 focused tests pass
- Vector indexes integrate seamlessly with existing schema system
- DDL generation produces correct DEFINE INDEX statements
- Index rebuild operations work correctly (drop + recreate)
- Migration workflow handles index changes in proper order
