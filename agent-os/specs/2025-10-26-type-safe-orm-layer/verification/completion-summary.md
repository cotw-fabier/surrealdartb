**Solution:** Added all ORM classes to lib/surrealdartb.dart exports
**Status:** All classes properly exported and accessible
**Verification:** Import tests successful

### Critical Issue #3: Incomplete Implementation (RESOLVED ✅)
**Original Problem:** 7 task groups unimplemented
**Solution:** Completed all remaining task groups (5, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17)
**Status:** 17/17 task groups complete (100%)
**Verification:** All acceptance criteria met

## Key Features Implemented

### Type-Safe CRUD Operations
```dart
// Create
final user = User(name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com');
final created = await db.create(user);

// Update
user.name = 'John Doe';
final updated = await db.update(user);

// Delete
await db.delete(user);
```

### Advanced Query Builder
```dart
// Complex queries with logical operators
final users = await db.query<User>()
  .where((t) =>
    (t.age.between(18, 65) & t.status.equals('active')) |
    t.role.equals('admin')
  )
  .orderBy('createdAt', descending: true)
  .limit(10)
  .execute();
```

### Relationship Management
```dart
// Record links with filtering
final users = await db.query<User>()
  .include('posts',
    where: (p) => p.status.equals('published'),
    orderBy: 'createdAt',
    limit: 5
  )
  .execute();

// Nested includes with independent filtering
final users = await db.query<User>()
  .include('posts',
    include: ['comments', 'tags'],
    where: (p) => p.status.equals('published')
  )
  .execute();
```

### Graph Relations
```dart
// Outgoing relations
@SurrealRelation(name: 'likes', direction: RelationDirection.out)
List<Post> likedPosts;

// Edge tables with metadata
@SurrealEdge('user_posts')
class UserPostEdge {
  @SurrealRecord() User user;
  @SurrealRecord() Post post;
  DateTime createdAt;
  String role;
}
```

### Next Steps for Production Deployment

1. **Update CHANGELOG.md** - Document all new features and breaking changes
2. **Update README.md** - Add ORM quick start section
3. **Publish Example Apps** - Create example projects demonstrating ORM usage
4. **Performance Testing** - Benchmark ORM performance vs raw QL methods
5. **Create Migration Scripts** - Tools to help users add annotations to existing models
