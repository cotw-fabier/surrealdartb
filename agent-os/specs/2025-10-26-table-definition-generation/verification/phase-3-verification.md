   - DatabaseSchema, TableSchema, FieldSchema, IndexSchema classes
   - INFO FOR DB/TABLE query execution
   - JSON serialization support
   - Comprehensive dartdoc comments

2. `lib/src/schema/diff_engine.dart` - 649 lines
   - SchemaDiff class with change detection logic
   - FieldModification tracking
   - Safe vs destructive classification
   - Deterministic SHA-256 hash generation

**Files Modified:**
1. `lib/src/exceptions.dart`
   - Added SchemaIntrospectionException extending DatabaseException

2. `lib/surrealdartb.dart`
   - Exported introspection classes to public API
   - Exported SchemaIntrospectionException

3. `pubspec.yaml`
   - Added crypto ^3.0.3 dependency for SHA-256 hashing

**Code Quality Metrics:**
- Functions are focused and concise (most under 20 lines)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive dartdoc documentation on all public APIs
- Proper null safety throughout
- Immutable data structures with const constructors where applicable
- Pattern matching with exhaustive switch statements
- No dead code or commented-out blocks

### Architecture & Design

**Strengths:**
1. **Stateless Design:** Schema introspection and diff calculation are pure functions with no side effects
2. **Separation of Concerns:** Introspection (reading schema) separated from diff calculation (comparing schemas)
3. **Type Safety:** Strong typing throughout with sealed classes for result types
4. **Serialization Support:** Schema snapshots can be stored/retrieved for migration history
5. **Deterministic Hashing:** Same changes always produce same hash for migration tracking
6. **Conservative Classification:** Errs on side of safety when classifying destructive changes

**Design Patterns Used:**
- Factory pattern (introspect() static methods)
- Builder pattern (schema snapshot construction)
- Strategy pattern (change classification logic)
- Value object pattern (immutable schema classes)

### Integration Quality

**Database Integration:**
- Uses existing Database.query() method (no FFI changes required)
- Proper error handling with new SchemaIntrospectionException
- Integrates seamlessly with existing exception hierarchy

**Type System Integration:**
- Correctly maps SurrealType instances to SurrealDB type strings
- Handles all supported types (primitives, collections, vectors, objects)
- Maintains consistency with existing type definitions

**Test Integration:**
- All tests use in-memory database for fast execution
- Proper setUp/tearDown lifecycle management
- Tests are independent and deterministic
- Integration with existing test infrastructure

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md

**Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT

**Evidence:**
- PascalCase for classes: DatabaseSchema, TableSchema, FieldSchema, IndexSchema, SchemaDiff, FieldModification
- camelCase for methods/variables: introspect(), hasTable(), getField(), fieldsAdded, tablesRemoved
- Arrow syntax for simple getters: `bool get hasChanges => ...`
- Pattern matching with exhaustive switches for SurrealType conversion
- Const constructors used where applicable
- Final-by-default for all variables
- Explicit type annotations on all public APIs
- Functions kept focused (most under 20 lines, some longer for complex logic)
- No dead code or commented blocks

**Deviations:** None significant. Some helper methods (hash generation, sorting) exceed 20 lines but remain focused on single responsibilities.

### agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md

**Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT

**Evidence:**
- SchemaIntrospectionException extends DatabaseException hierarchy
- Error messages include context about what operation failed
- Preserves original exceptions when rethrowing with additional context
- No ignored errors - all failure paths throw explicit exceptions
- Null safety enforced throughout
- Returns empty collections rather than null for missing data

**Deviations:** None. No FFI calls in this module, so FFI-specific error handling not applicable.

### agent-os/standards/global/commenting.md

**Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT

**Evidence:**
- Comprehensive dartdoc comments on all public classes and methods
- Example usage provided in class-level documentation
- Parameters documented with `[paramName]` format
- Return values documented with "Returns" clause
- Complex algorithms explained with inline comments
- Edge cases documented in method comments

**Sample documentation quality:**
```dart
/// Introspects the current database schema using INFO FOR DB.
///
/// Executes an INFO FOR DB query to retrieve the complete database schema,
/// then parses the response to build a structured representation.
///
/// [db] - The database connection to introspect
///
/// Returns a DatabaseSchema snapshot of the current state.
///
/// Throws [SchemaIntrospectionException] if introspection fails.
```

**Deviations:** None.

### agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md

**Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT

**Evidence:**
- File structure follows conventions (lib/src/schema/ for implementation, test/ for tests)
- Class naming is clear and descriptive
- Parse() factory methods follow json_serializable patterns
- toJson()/fromJson() serialization methods consistent with codebase
- Test file naming matches implementation files

**Deviations:** None.

### agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md

**Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT

**Evidence:**
- Tests follow Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
- Descriptive test names clearly describe scenarios
- Tests are independent (no shared state)
- Fast execution using in-memory databases
- Each test validates single aspect
- Proper setUp/tearDown lifecycle
- Test count (8 + 13 = 21) follows guideline of 2-8 per task group (exceeded for comprehensive coverage)

**Test Examples:**
```dart
test('3.1.1 - INFO FOR DB query executes successfully', () async {
  // Arrange: Create test table
  await db.query('DEFINE TABLE test_users SCHEMAFULL; ...');

  // Act: Execute INFO FOR DB
  final response = await db.query('INFO FOR DB');

  // Assert: Verify results
  expect(results, isNotEmpty);
});
```

**Deviations:** Task 3.2.1 has 13 tests instead of 2-8, but this provides comprehensive coverage of all change detection scenarios as required by acceptance criteria.

### agent-os/standards/backend/async-patterns.md

**Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT

**Evidence:**
- All introspection methods return Future<T>
- Proper async/await usage throughout
- Reuses existing Database.query() async infrastructure
- No blocking operations
- Consistent async patterns with rest of codebase

**Deviations:** None.

### agent-os/standards/global/validation.md

**Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT

**Evidence:**
- Schema parsing validates field definitions
- Null checks before dereferencing
- Empty collections handled gracefully
- Type validation in diff calculation
- Clear error messages for validation failures

**Deviations:** None.

### agent-os/standards/global/tech-stack.md

**Compliance Status:** COMPLIANT

**Evidence:**
- Pure Dart implementation (no FFI changes)
- Uses standard library packages (dart:convert)
- Added crypto package for SHA-256 (standard, well-maintained package)
- No additional platform dependencies

**Deviations:** None.
