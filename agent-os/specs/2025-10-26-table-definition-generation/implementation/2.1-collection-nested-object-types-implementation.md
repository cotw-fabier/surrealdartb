# Task 2.1: Collection & Nested Object Types

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #2.1 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-26-table-definition-generation/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** database-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Status:** Complete

### Task Description
Implement support for collection types (List, Set, Map) and recursive nested object generation in the table definition generator. This includes handling generic type parameters, detecting and traversing custom class types, generating nested FieldDefinition structures, and detecting circular references gracefully.

## Implementation Summary

Successfully extended the SurrealDB table definition generation system to support advanced collection types and nested object schemas. The implementation adds three major capabilities:

1. **Collection Type Mapping**: Extended TypeMapper to handle List<T>, Set<T>, and Map<K,V> types with proper generic parameter extraction and recursive mapping of element types. This enables developers to use Dart collection types naturally in their schema annotations.

2. **Recursive Nested Object Generation**: Implemented a sophisticated traversal system in the generator that detects custom class types, recursively extracts their schemas, and generates complete nested FieldDefinition structures. The system automatically infers types for nested classes that don't have explicit @SurrealField annotations, making the API more ergonomic.

3. **Circular Reference Detection**: Added a visited-types tracking mechanism that detects both direct (A -> A) and indirect (A -> B -> A) circular references and throws clear InvalidGenerationSourceError messages when they're encountered. This prevents infinite recursion and provides actionable error messages to developers.

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility with Phase 1 functionality while adding these advanced features. All 44 tests pass, including 11 new tests for advanced type mapping and 14 tests documenting the nested object generation behavior.

## Key Implementation Details

### Collection Type Mapping (TypeMapper)
**Location:** `lib/generator/type_mapper.dart`

Extended the TypeMapper class to handle collection types by adding:

1. **Generic Type Parameter Extraction**: Implemented `_extractGenericType()` method that parses generic type strings (e.g., "List<String>") and correctly handles nested generics (e.g., "List<List<int>>") by tracking bracket depth.

2. **Collection Type Detection**: Added pattern matching for:
   - `List<T>` → `ArrayType(mapped T)`
   - `Set<T>` → `ArrayType(mapped T)` (sets map to arrays in SurrealDB)
   - `Map<K,V>` or `Map` → `ObjectType()`
   - Unparameterized collections (`List`, `Set`) → `ArrayType(AnyType())`

3. **Recursive Mapping**: The mapper recursively calls itself on element types, enabling support for deeply nested collections like `List<List<Map<String, List<int>>>>`.

**Rationale:** This approach maintains the stateless, string-based nature of TypeMapper while adding sophisticated parsing capabilities. The recursive design naturally handles arbitrary nesting depth without explicit recursion limits.

### Recursive Nested Object Generation (Generator)
**Location:** `lib/generator/surreal_table_generator.dart`

Added comprehensive nested object support through three key mechanisms:

1. **Custom Class Detection**: When processing a field with `ObjectType` annotation, the generator checks if the Dart field type is a custom class (not a built-in type). If so, it triggers recursive schema extraction.

2. **Recursive Schema Extraction** (`_extractNestedSchema`):
   - Maintains a `_visitedTypes` set to track classes currently being processed
   - Checks for circular references before processing each class
   - Extracts all fields from nested classes (without requiring @SurrealField)
   - Recursively processes nested custom classes to arbitrary depth
   - Cleans up visited types after processing (using try/finally)

3. **Type Inference** (`_inferTypeFromDartType`):
   - Automatically maps Dart types to SurrealDB types for nested classes
   - Handles basic types, collections, and unknown types (maps to ObjectType)
   - Enables developers to use plain Dart classes without annotations as nested objects

**Rationale:** This design provides an ergonomic API where developers only need @SurrealField on the top-level table class. Nested classes are automatically discovered and their schemas inferred. The circular reference detection prevents infinite recursion while providing clear error messages about the specific circular dependency.

### Circular Reference Detection
**Location:** `lib/generator/surreal_table_generator.dart`

Implemented a visited-types tracking system:

1. **Detection Mechanism**: The `_visitedTypes` Set tracks class names currently being processed in the recursion stack.

2. **Error Handling**: When a circular reference is detected, throws `InvalidGenerationSourceError` with a clear message: "Circular reference detected: ClassName references itself. Circular references are not supported in nested objects."

3. **Cleanup**: Uses try/finally to ensure visited types are removed after processing, allowing the same class to appear in different branches of the object tree.

**Rationale:** Circular references are fundamentally incompatible with SurrealDB's object type system, so we fail fast with a clear error rather than attempting to handle them. The visited-types set has minimal overhead and ensures we detect circular references at the earliest possible point.

### Field Information Storage Extension
**Location:** `lib/generator/surreal_table_generator.dart` (_FieldInfo class)

Extended the internal `_FieldInfo` class to support nested schemas:

1. Added `nestedSchema` field to store recursively extracted schemas
2. Added `inferredTypeExpr` field for type-inferred nested fields
3. Updated `_generateFieldDefinition` to handle nested schema generation

**Rationale:** This approach keeps the nested schema information attached to the field it belongs to, making the generation logic cleaner and more maintainable.

## Integration Points (if applicable)

### Internal Dependencies
- **TypeMapper** integrates with **SurrealTableGenerator** - The generator calls TypeMapper methods, but in this phase we use annotation-based types directly. TypeMapper is available for future enhancements.
- **SurrealTableGenerator** integrates with **analyzer package** - Uses InterfaceType, ClassElement, and DartType for type introspection and generic parameter extraction.
- **Generated code** integrates with **TableStructure** and **FieldDefinition** - Nested schemas use the same ObjectType(schema: ...) pattern as Phase 1.

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified.

### Limitations

1. **Nested Classes Require Accessible Fields**
   - Description: For nested object generation to work, the nested class must have accessible (public) fields.
   - Reason: The analyzer can only introspect public members of classes.
   - Future Consideration: Could add support for getter methods or private fields with public getters.

2. **No Support for Circular References**
   - Description: Circular references (A -> B -> A) are explicitly not supported and throw errors.
   - Reason: SurrealDB's object type system doesn't support circular references in schemas.
   - Future Consideration: This is a fundamental limitation and unlikely to change. Developers should use record IDs for circular relationships.

3. **Type Inference is Best-Effort**
   - Description: Type inference for nested objects without @SurrealField annotations uses basic Dart type information.
   - Reason: Without explicit annotations, we can't determine SurrealDB-specific constraints (ASSERT clauses, indexes, etc.).
   - Future Consideration: Could enhance inference to detect common patterns (e.g., String fields named 'email' could infer email validation).

4. **Map Key Types Not Validated**
   - Description: Map<K, V> maps to ObjectType regardless of key type K.
   - Reason: SurrealDB objects always have string keys, so we ignore the K parameter.
   - Future Consideration: Could validate that K is String or dynamic and warn if not.

## Performance Considerations

- **Generic Type Parsing**: The `_extractGenericType` method uses a simple character-by-character scan with bracket depth tracking. This is O(n) in the length of the type string, which is acceptable since type strings are typically short (<100 chars).

- **Visited Types Tracking**: Uses a Set for O(1) lookup when checking for circular references. Memory overhead is minimal (typically <10 class names even for complex schemas).

- **Recursive Traversal**: Bounded by the depth of the object tree. Most real-world schemas are 2-4 levels deep. The implementation has no artificial limits, allowing developers to create deep structures if needed.

- **No Performance Degradation**: Phase 1 functionality (basic types) is unaffected. The new code only executes when collection or custom class types are encountered.

## Security Considerations

- **No Security Impact**: Code generation happens at build time, not runtime. The generated code is source code that developers review before deployment.

- **Input Validation**: Type strings are validated during parsing. Invalid type strings throw appropriate errors rather than causing crashes.

- **No Code Injection Risk**: All generated code uses compile-time type information from the analyzer. There's no string concatenation of user input or dynamic code execution.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks

**Task Group 2.2** (Vector Types & Schema Constraints) depends on this implementation:
- Task 2.2 will build on the type mapping infrastructure added here
- The generator's field extraction and generation logic will be extended for vectors, ASSERT clauses, and indexes
- The ObjectType schema generation will be leveraged for vector type schemas

## Notes

### Design Decisions

1. **Why Type Inference for Nested Classes?**
   - Makes the API more ergonomic by not requiring @SurrealField on every nested class
   - Follows the principle of least surprise (Dart types map naturally to SurrealDB types)
   - Developers can still use @SurrealField on nested classes if they need explicit control

2. **Why Fail on Circular References?**
   - SurrealDB doesn't support circular references in object schemas
   - Better to fail fast at generation time than at runtime
   - Encourages developers to use record IDs for circular relationships (which is the correct pattern)

3. **Why Track Visited Types in a Set?**
   - Simple and efficient (O(1) lookup)
   - Naturally handles both direct and indirect circular references
   - Easy to debug (can inspect the set to see the reference chain)

### Future Enhancements

1. **Generic Type Constraints**: Could validate that type parameters in collections are supported types (e.g., List<CustomUnsupportedType> should warn).

2. **Schema Validation**: Could add validation that generated nested schemas don't exceed SurrealDB's nesting limits (if any exist).

3. **Performance Optimization**: Could cache inferred types for nested classes to avoid re-inferring the same class multiple times in large schemas.

4. **Enhanced Error Messages**: Could show the full circular reference chain (A -> B -> C -> A) in error messages rather than just "A references itself".

### Sample Generated Code

For a class with nested objects:

```dart
@SurrealTable('users')
class User {
  @SurrealField(type: StringType())
  final String name;

  @SurrealField(type: ObjectType())
  final Address address;

  @SurrealField(type: ArrayType(StringType()))
  final List<String> tags;
}

class Address {
  final String street;
  final String city;
  final String? zipCode;
}
```

Generates:

```dart
final userTableDefinition = TableStructure(
  'users',
  {
    'name': FieldDefinition(
      StringType(),
    ),
    'address': FieldDefinition(
      ObjectType(),
      schema: {
        'street': FieldDefinition(
          StringType(),
        ),
        'city': FieldDefinition(
          StringType(),
        ),
        'zipCode': FieldDefinition(
          StringType(),
          optional: true,
        ),
      },
    ),
    'tags': FieldDefinition(
      ArrayType(StringType()),
    ),
  },
);
```

Note how:
- The nested Address schema is automatically extracted
- nullable types (zipCode?) are marked as optional
- List<String> maps to ArrayType(StringType())
- The generated code is readable and properly indented
