## Key Implementation Details

### Example Scenarios (example/scenarios/)

**Location:** `example/scenarios/table_generation_basic.dart`

Created foundational example demonstrating the simplest workflow:
- Schema definition with annotations (`@SurrealTable`, `@SurrealField`)
- What build_runner generates (TableDefinition classes)
- Database connection with auto-migration enabled
- Data insertion with schema validation (ASSERT clauses)
- Clear step-by-step walkthrough with formatted output

**Key Features:**
- Self-contained, runnable example
- Visual formatting with box characters for clarity
- Demonstrates both success and failure cases
- Shows ASSERT clause validation in action
- Documents expected generated code structure

**Rationale:** Provides the "hello world" example for new users. Demonstrates the minimal steps needed to get started with table generation and auto-migration.

---

**Location:** `example/scenarios/migration_workflows.dart`

Created workflow comparison demonstrating development vs production approaches:
- **Part A (Development):** Auto-migration for rapid iteration, schema evolution without manual steps
- **Part B (Production):** Manual migration with dry-run preview, safety validation, migration history tracking
- **Bonus:** Handling destructive changes with explicit permission

**Key Features:**
- Side-by-side comparison of workflows
- Complete production deployment procedure
- Preview migration before applying
- Migration history querying
- Destructive change handling patterns

**Rationale:** Addresses the #1 question developers have: "How do I use this in production?" Shows clear distinction between dev convenience and production safety.

---

**Location:** `example/scenarios/migration_safety_rollback.dart`

Created safety-focused example demonstrating production reliability features:
- **Part A:** Automatic rollback when migrations fail (transaction safety)
- **Part B:** Manual rollback procedures for intentional schema reversion
- **Part C:** Understanding transaction safety guarantees

**Key Features:**
- Explains transaction-based execution (BEGIN → COMMIT/CANCEL)
- Demonstrates automatic rollback on failure
- Shows manual rollback workflow with migration history
- Documents safety guarantees explicitly
- Provides production deployment checklist

**Rationale:** Addresses production concerns about migration safety and recovery. Critical for building confidence in the system's reliability.

### Migration Guide (MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)

**Location:** `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`

Created comprehensive 400+ line production guide covering:

1. **Overview** - Feature summary and key benefits
2. **Quick Start** - 3-step getting started guide
3. **Development Workflow** - Fast iteration patterns with auto-migration
4. **Production Workflow** - 5-step safe deployment procedure
5. **Migration Safety** - Transaction guarantees, safe vs destructive classification
6. **Preview Migrations** - Dry-run mode usage and MigrationReport structure
7. **Handling Destructive Changes** - 3 options (permission, manual migration, fix schema) with complete procedures
8. **Rollback Procedures** - Automatic and manual rollback with step-by-step instructions
9. **Best Practices** - Development, production, and schema design best practices
10. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions with code examples
11. **Migration History** - Understanding and querying the _migrations table

**Key Sections:**

**Safe vs Destructive Changes:**
- Clear categorization of what's safe vs destructive
- When each type of change requires permission
- Impact analysis for each change type

**Production Workflow (5 Steps):**
1. Connect without auto-migration
2. Preview migration (dry-run)
3. Review generated DDL
4. Apply if safe
5. Verify and check history

**Destructive Change Handling:**
- Option 1: Explicit permission (use with caution)
- Option 2: Manual data migration (recommended)
- Option 3: Fix the schema (non-destructive)
- Complete code examples for each option
- Checklist before applying destructive migrations

**Rollback Procedures:**
- Automatic rollback (on failure)
- Manual rollback (intentional revert)
- 4-step manual rollback procedure
- Edge case handling

**Best Practices:**
- Development: Fast iteration with auto-migration
- Production: Manual control with preview

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Known SurrealDB Compatibility Issues (Documented)
1. **Vector DDL Syntax**
   - Current SurrealDB embedded does not support `vector<F32, N>` syntax
   - Documented in README, CHANGELOG, and migration guide
   - Workaround provided: Use `array<float>` type

2. **Nested Object Access**
   - Nested object values may return null in some queries
   - Documented in README and CHANGELOG
   - Workaround provided: Use raw SurrealQL queries

**Impact:** These are SurrealDB embedded limitations, not package limitations. Core migration functionality is production-ready for primary use cases.

### Documentation Limitations
None identified. All task requirements fulfilled.

## Performance Considerations

Documentation-only task - no performance impact on runtime. Documentation improvements may speed up developer onboarding and reduce support questions.

## Security Considerations

Examples demonstrate security best practices:
- Proper database connection cleanup (try-finally)
- Safe parameter handling
- Transaction safety for data integrity
- Backup procedures before destructive changes
- Migration history for audit trails

## Dependencies for Other Tasks

This task completes Phase 6 of the specification. No other tasks depend on this documentation work. Future enhancements may reference this documentation as a starting point for additional features.

## Notes

### Documentation Philosophy

Focused on **practical, production-ready patterns** rather than comprehensive API enumeration:
- Every example is runnable and self-contained
- Clear distinction between dev and prod workflows
- Emphasis on safety and reliability
- Troubleshooting guidance for common issues
- Real-world scenarios over toy examples

### Coverage Analysis

**What's Documented:**
✅ Basic annotation and generation (table_generation_basic.dart)
✅ Development workflow with auto-migration (migration_workflows.dart)
✅ Production workflow with manual control (migration_workflows.dart)
✅ Dry-run preview mode (migration_workflows.dart, MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
✅ Rollback procedures (migration_safety_rollback.dart, MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
✅ Safety features (migration_safety_rollback.dart)
✅ Destructive change handling (migration_workflows.dart, MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
✅ Transaction safety guarantees (migration_safety_rollback.dart, MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
✅ Migration history querying (migration_workflows.dart, MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
✅ Production deployment checklists (migration_safety_rollback.dart, MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)

**Intentionally Not Documented (Out of Scope):**
- Vector field example with embeddings (SurrealDB compatibility issues)
- Nested object evolution example (SurrealDB compatibility issues)
- Custom converter examples (not yet implemented)

These omissions align with the verification report's findings that vector DDL and nested objects have known SurrealDB compatibility issues. Documentation focuses on what WORKS in production.
