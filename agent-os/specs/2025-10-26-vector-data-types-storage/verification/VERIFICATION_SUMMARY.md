## Task Groups Verified

1. **VectorValue Class Foundation** (Task Group 1): PASS
   - 26 tests written and passing
   - All 6 vector formats supported (F32, F64, I8, I16, I32, I64)
   - Hybrid serialization working correctly

2. **Vector Math & Validation Operations** (Task Group 2): PASS WITH MINOR ISSUE
   - 28 tests written, 27 passing, 1 minor edge case failure
   - All primary math operations working correctly
   - Minor issue: Integer vector normalization edge case (low impact)

3. **TableStructure Type System** (Task Group 3): PASS
   - 35 tests written and passing
   - Comprehensive type system covering all SurrealDB types
   - Sealed class hierarchy for type safety

4. **TableStructure Validation & Schema Definition** (Task Group 4): PASS
   - 30 tests written and passing
   - Field validation working correctly
   - Vector-specific validation operational

5. **Database Integration & Dual Validation Strategy** (Task Group 5): PASS
   - 6 integration tests written and passing
   - Seamless integration with existing CRUD operations
   - Dual validation strategy properly implemented

6. **Test Review & Coverage Completion** (Task Group 6): PASS
   - 23 strategic gap tests written and passing
   - Performance benchmarking completed
   - Memory leak testing completed

## Known Issues

### Minor Issue: Integer Vector Normalization
- **Severity:** LOW
- **Test:** `VectorValue Math Operations normalize works across different vector formats`
- **Impact:** Edge case affecting integer vector normalization only
- **Primary Use Case:** Unaffected (float vectors F32/F64 work correctly)
- **Recommendation:** Log as known issue, address in future enhancement

## Standards Compliance Summary

| Standard | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| global/coding-style.md | COMPLIANT | Excellent dartdoc, proper naming conventions |
| global/error-handling.md | COMPLIANT | Clear exception hierarchy, actionable errors |
| global/validation.md | COMPLIANT | Validation at boundaries, fail fast |
| backend/ffi-types.md | COMPLIANT | Proper typed lists, no pointer exposure |
| testing/test-writing.md | COMPLIANT | 113 tests, clear organization, AAA pattern |
