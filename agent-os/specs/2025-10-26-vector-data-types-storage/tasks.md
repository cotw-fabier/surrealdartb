- **None** - This feature builds entirely on existing Phase 1 infrastructure

### Internal Dependencies
- **Phase 1 Complete:** FFI infrastructure, CRUD operations, SurrealQL execution (COMPLETE per context)
- **Existing Types:** RecordId, Datetime patterns to follow (AVAILABLE)
- **Testing Infrastructure:** Test framework and patterns established (AVAILABLE)

### Potential Blockers
1. **Platform Testing Environment:** Cross-platform testing requires multiple OS environments
   - Mitigation: Prioritize available platforms, document limitations
   - Mitigation: Use CI/CD for automated cross-platform testing

2. **SurrealDB Documentation Gaps:** Type system details may be incomplete
   - Mitigation: Review official Rust SDK source code as reference
   - Mitigation: Design for extensibility to handle future discoveries

3. **Performance Requirements:** Mobile device performance may not meet targets
   - Mitigation: Early benchmarking in development phase
   - Mitigation: Document performance characteristics and limitations
   - Mitigation: Provide guidance on vector size limits

## Notes

### Implementation Strategy
- **No New FFI Functions:** This feature entirely reuses existing FFI infrastructure from Phase 1
- **Additive Only:** No breaking changes to existing APIs
- **Type Safety First:** Leverage Dart's type system for compile-time safety
- **Mobile-First Performance:** Optimize for resource-constrained devices
- **Clear Error Messages:** Distinguish Dart validation from SurrealDB validation

### Testing Strategy
- **Focused Tests During Development:** Each task group writes 4-10 tests maximum (increased for all vector types)
- **Test What You Build:** Verify only the code written in that task group
- **Defer Comprehensive Coverage:** testing-engineer fills gaps in Task Group 6
- **Actual Total Tests:** 149 tests (125 existing + 23 strategic + 1 fixture) - exceeds target
- **Cross-Platform Validation:** Ensure consistency across all supported platforms
- **Performance Validation:** Verify hybrid serialization strategy and all vector formats

### Standards Compliance
