# Task 1: VectorValue Class Foundation

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #1 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-26-vector-data-types-storage/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Create the foundational VectorValue class with support for all SurrealDB vector types (F32, F64, I8, I16, I32, I64), including format-specific constructors, generic factory constructors, serialization methods, and full integration with the SDK's type system.

## Implementation Summary

The VectorValue class has been successfully implemented as a type-safe, memory-efficient wrapper for vector embeddings. The implementation follows the established patterns from RecordId and Datetime types, providing a Dart-idiomatic API that seamlessly integrates with SurrealDB's FFI layer.

Key design decisions:
1. **Multi-format support**: Used Dart's typed lists (Float32List, Int16List, etc.) for optimal memory efficiency and type safety
2. **Hybrid serialization**: Implemented automatic format selection based on vector dimensions (≤100 = JSON, >100 = binary)
3. **Validation-first**: All constructors validate input data (no empty lists, no NaN/Infinity for floats)
4. **Binary format**: Little-endian byte order with format header for cross-platform consistency

The implementation includes 26 comprehensive tests covering all constructors, accessors, serialization, and equality operations across all supported formats.

## Files Changed/Created

### New Files
- `lib/src/types/vector_value.dart` - Core VectorValue class with all formats and serialization methods
- `test/vector_value_test.dart` - 26 tests covering factory constructors, named constructors, accessors, serialization, and equality

### Modified Files
- `lib/src/types/types.dart` - Added export for vector_value.dart
- `lib/surrealdartb.dart` - Added VectorValue and VectorFormat to public API exports

## Key Implementation Details

### VectorValue Class Structure
**Location:** `lib/src/types/vector_value.dart`

The class uses a private dynamic `_data` field that holds format-specific typed lists (Float32List, Float64List, Int8List, Int16List, Int32List, Int64List). This design ensures:
- Memory efficiency through native typed arrays
- Type safety at runtime
- Optimal FFI interop performance

**Rationale:** Following Dart best practices, we use typed lists for numeric data to avoid boxing overhead and ensure predictable memory layout. The dynamic type allows us to support multiple formats while maintaining a clean API.

### VectorFormat Enum
**Location:** `lib/src/types/vector_value.dart`

```dart
enum VectorFormat {
  f32,  // 32-bit floating-point (primary)
  f64,  // 64-bit floating-point (high-precision)
  i8,   // 8-bit signed integer (quantized)
  i16,  // 16-bit signed integer (quantized)
  i32,  // 32-bit signed integer (quantized)
  i64,  // 64-bit signed integer (quantized)
}
```

**Rationale:** Explicit enum provides type safety and exhaustive pattern matching. Supports all SurrealDB vector types including quantized formats for storage optimization.

### Format-Specific Named Constructors
**Location:** `lib/src/types/vector_value.dart`

Six named constructors for explicit format creation:
- `VectorValue.f32(List<double>)` - Primary type for embedding models
- `VectorValue.f64(List<double>)` - High-precision floating-point
- `VectorValue.i8(List<int>)` - 8-bit quantized
- `VectorValue.i16(List<int>)` - 16-bit quantized
- `VectorValue.i32(List<int>)` - 32-bit quantized
- `VectorValue.i64(List<int>)` - 64-bit quantized

All constructors validate:
- Non-empty input lists
- NaN/Infinity detection (for float formats)

**Rationale:** Named constructors provide clarity about the vector format being created and allow the compiler to enforce correct input types (double for floats, int for integers).

### Generic Factory Constructors
**Location:** `lib/src/types/vector_value.dart`

Four factory constructors for flexible creation:
1. `VectorValue.fromList(List<num>, {VectorFormat format})` - Create from Dart list with optional format
2. `VectorValue.fromString(String, {VectorFormat format})` - Parse "[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]" format
3. `VectorValue.fromBytes(Uint8List, VectorFormat)` - Deserialize binary with format header
4. `VectorValue.fromJson(dynamic, {VectorFormat format})` - For FFI deserialization

All default to F32 format when not specified, as this is the primary format for embedding models.

**Rationale:** Generic constructors support common integration patterns (JSON from API, string from config, bytes from storage) while maintaining type safety through explicit format parameters.

### Hybrid Serialization Strategy
**Location:** `lib/src/types/vector_value.dart`

Three serialization methods:
1. `toJson()` - Always returns List for JSON encoding
2. `toBytes()` - Always returns Uint8List with binary format
3. `toBinaryOrJson()` - Auto-selects based on dimensions

Binary format specification:
- Byte 0: Format enum (0=F32, 1=F64, 2=I8, 3=I16, 4=I32, 5=I64)
- Bytes 1-4: Dimension count (little-endian uint32)
- Remaining bytes: Data payload (format-specific element size)

Threshold configuration via static field: `VectorValue.serializationThreshold = 100`

**Rationale:** Small vectors (≤100 dimensions) benefit from JSON's simplicity and debuggability. Large vectors (>100 dimensions) benefit significantly from binary serialization's performance and memory efficiency. The configurable threshold allows tuning based on profiling results.

### Validation and Error Handling
**Location:** `lib/src/types/vector_value.dart`

Private validation helper `_validateValues()` checks:
- Non-empty lists
- No NaN values
- No Infinity values

Throws ArgumentError with descriptive messages including:
- Format name
- Index of invalid value
- Type of validation failure

**Rationale:** Early validation prevents invalid data from entering the system. Clear error messages with context help developers quickly identify and fix issues.

### Equality and HashCode
**Location:** `lib/src/types/vector_value.dart`

- `operator ==`: Element-wise comparison with format and dimension checks
- `hashCode`: Uses Object.hashAll() with format and all elements

**Rationale:** Follows Dart best practices for value equality. Two vectors are equal only if they have the same format, dimensions, and element values.

## Database Changes
No database changes required - this is a pure Dart type implementation.

## Dependencies
No new dependencies added. Uses only Dart SDK built-in types:
- `dart:typed_data` for Float32List, Int16List, etc.

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated

## Integration Points

### APIs/Endpoints
No HTTP endpoints - this is an internal type used by Database class for vector storage/retrieval.

### Internal Dependencies
- Exported from `lib/src/types/types.dart` for internal use
- Exported from `lib/surrealdartb.dart` for public API
- Will be used by Task Group 2 for vector math operations
- Will be used by Task Group 4 for schema validation
- Will be used by Task Group 5 for database integration

### Future Integration Points
- VectorValue will be used in CRUD operations: `db.create('table', {'embedding': vector.toJson()})`
- Will integrate with TableStructure validation in Task Group 4
- Will support vector math operations in Task Group 2

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified at this time.

### Limitations
1. **No Type Conversion**: VectorValue does not automatically convert between formats (e.g., F32 to I8). This is intentional to avoid precision loss without explicit developer action.
2. **Memory for Large Vectors**: Very large vectors (>100,000 dimensions) may cause memory pressure on resource-constrained devices. This is a known trade-off documented in the spec.
3. **No Compression**: Vector data is stored uncompressed. Compression/quantization is out of scope for this milestone.

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Footprint
- F32: 4 bytes per dimension
- F64: 8 bytes per dimension
- I8: 1 byte per dimension
- I16: 2 bytes per dimension
- I32: 4 bytes per dimension
- I64: 8 bytes per dimension

Plus 5 bytes overhead for binary format header (format + dimensions).

### Serialization Performance
Based on spec requirements:
- Small vectors (≤100 dimensions): JSON overhead negligible
- Large vectors (>100 dimensions): Binary serialization provides 2-3x performance improvement

Actual benchmarking deferred to Task Group 6.

### CPU Efficiency
- Typed lists provide optimal CPU cache locality
- No boxing/unboxing overhead for numeric operations
- Element access is O(1)

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- All constructors validate input to prevent invalid data
- NaN/Infinity detection prevents invalid mathematical operations
- Empty list detection prevents degenerate cases

### Memory Safety
- Uses Dart's managed memory (no manual allocation)
- Typed lists prevent buffer overflows
- No raw pointer exposure in public API

### Data Integrity
- Binary format includes format header for verification
- Little-endian byte order specified for cross-platform consistency
- Round-trip serialization tested for all formats

## Dependencies for Other Tasks

This implementation is a prerequisite for:
- **Task Group 2**: Vector math operations require VectorValue as input
- **Task Group 4**: TableStructure validation will use VectorValue.validateDimensions()
- **Task Group 5**: Database integration will use VectorValue serialization methods

## Notes

### Design Decisions
1. **Dynamic _data field**: Allows support for multiple typed list types while maintaining clean API
2. **Static serializationThreshold**: Provides global configuration point that can be tuned based on profiling
3. **Separate toJson/toBytes/toBinaryOrJson**: Gives developers explicit control when needed, with convenience auto-selection
4. **Format parameter defaults to F32**: Aligns with primary use case (embedding models)

### Future Enhancements
- Could add type conversion methods (e.g., toF32(), toI8()) with explicit precision handling
- Could add compression support for storage optimization
- Could add SIMD-accelerated operations for supported platforms

### Lessons Learned
- Dart's typed lists provide excellent performance and type safety for numeric data
- Explicit format tracking prevents subtle bugs from implicit conversions
- Comprehensive dartdoc with examples is essential for developer experience
- Testing all serialization round-trips catches binary format bugs early
