# Task 1: Build Infrastructure and Dependencies

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task Group 1 from `/Users/fabier/Documents/code/surrealdartb/agent-os/specs/2025-10-21-initial-ffi-bindings-setup/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** database-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Status:** Complete

### Task Description
Set up the foundational build infrastructure for Rust-to-Dart FFI integration using native_toolchain_rs, including dependency management, Rust toolchain configuration, and build hooks for automatic native library compilation.

## Implementation Summary
This task established the complete build infrastructure for the SurrealDB Dart FFI bindings project. The implementation focused on configuring all necessary dependencies, toolchains, and build automation to enable seamless Rust-to-Dart FFI integration using the native_toolchain_rs package.

The infrastructure was configured to support multi-platform compilation (macOS, iOS, Android, Windows, Linux) with macOS as the primary development platform. The Rust toolchain was pinned to version 1.90.0 for reproducible builds, and SurrealDB was configured with minimal features (kv-mem and kv-rocksdb only) to reduce compilation time and binary size.

A build hook was implemented to automatically compile the Rust native library during the Dart build process, eliminating the need for manual compilation steps and ensuring the native library is always in sync with the Dart code.

## Files Changed/Created

### Modified Files
- `/Users/fabier/Documents/code/surrealdartb/pubspec.yaml` - Updated to use git dependency for native_toolchain_rs with pinned commit hash 34fc6155224d844f70b3fc631fb0b0049c4d51c6, ensuring version compatibility and reproducible builds.
- `/Users/fabier/Documents/code/surrealdartb/hook/build.dart` - Added missing import for package:hooks/hooks.dart to enable proper build hook functionality.

### Existing Files Verified
- `/Users/fabier/Documents/code/surrealdartb/Cargo.toml` - Already correctly configured with SurrealDB dependencies and release profile optimizations.
- `/Users/fabier/Documents/code/surrealdartb/rust-toolchain.toml` - Already correctly configured with Rust 1.90.0 and all required platform targets.

## Key Implementation Details

### Task 1.1: Research and Identify Stable native_toolchain_rs Commit
**Location:** GitHub research and documentation

Researched the native_toolchain_rs repository (https://github.com/GregoryConrad/native_toolchain_rs) to identify a recent stable commit. Selected commit hash `34fc6155224d844f70b3fc631fb0b0049c4d51c6` which corresponds to the latest release (v0.1.2+3) from October 18, 2025. This commit is recent (less than 1 week old) and represents a tagged release, ensuring stability.

**Rationale:** Using a pinned commit hash from a git repository (rather than a pub.dev version) ensures reproducible builds across all development environments and prevents unexpected breaking changes from dependency updates. The selected commit is associated with a tagged release, providing additional stability guarantees.

### Task 1.2: Update pubspec.yaml with Required Dependencies
**Location:** `/Users/fabier/Documents/code/surrealdartb/pubspec.yaml`

Updated the native_toolchain_rs dependency from pub.dev version `^0.1.2` to a git dependency with the pinned commit hash. The configuration now uses:
```yaml
native_toolchain_rs:
  git:
    url: https://github.com/GregoryConrad/native_toolchain_rs
    ref: 34fc6155224d844f70b3fc631fb0b0049c4d51c6
    path: native_toolchain_rs
```

The `path` parameter was necessary because the repository is a monorepo workspace, and we need to specify the package subdirectory.

**Rationale:** Git dependencies with pinned commit hashes provide version stability and reproducibility across development environments. This approach is mandated by the rust-integration.md standards and ensures all team members and CI/CD systems use identical dependency versions.

### Task 1.3: Verify rust-toolchain.toml Configuration
**Location:** `/Users/fabier/Documents/code/surrealdartb/rust-toolchain.toml`

Verified that the existing rust-toolchain.toml file correctly pins the Rust toolchain to version 1.90.0 and includes all required platform targets:
- aarch64-apple-darwin (Apple Silicon macOS)
- x86_64-apple-darwin (Intel macOS)
- aarch64-apple-ios (iOS ARM64)
- aarch64-linux-android (Android ARM64)
- armv7-linux-androideabi (Android ARMv7)
- x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (Windows x64)
- x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (Linux x64)
- aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu (Linux ARM64)

**Rationale:** Pinning the Rust toolchain to an exact version prevents build inconsistencies caused by Rust updates. The comprehensive platform target list ensures the project is prepared for multi-platform deployment, even though initial development focuses on macOS.

### Task 1.4: Verify Cargo.toml Configuration
**Location:** `/Users/fabier/Documents/code/surrealdartb/Cargo.toml`

Verified that the existing Cargo.toml correctly configures:
- Library crate type as both "staticlib" and "cdylib" for cross-platform FFI compatibility
- SurrealDB dependency with minimal features: `{ version = "2.0", default-features = false, features = ["kv-mem", "kv-rocksdb"] }`
- Tokio dependency for async runtime: `{ version = "1", features = ["rt-multi-thread"] }`
- Additional dependencies: serde, serde_json for data serialization
- Release profile with aggressive size optimization: opt-level = "z", lto = true, codegen-units = 1, strip = true

**Rationale:** The minimal SurrealDB feature set reduces compilation time and binary size while providing the essential storage backends needed for this phase. The release profile optimizations prioritize binary size reduction, which is critical for mobile platforms.

### Task 1.5: Update hook/build.dart for Automatic Rust Compilation
**Location:** `/Users/fabier/Documents/code/surrealdartb/hook/build.dart`

Added the missing import statement `import 'package:hooks/hooks.dart';` to the build hook file. The complete build hook now:
```dart
import 'package:hooks/hooks.dart';
import 'package:native_toolchain_rs/native_toolchain_rs.dart';

void main(List<String> args) async {
  await build(args, (input, output) async {
    await RustBuilder(
      assetName: 'package:surrealdartb/surrealdartb_bindings',
    ).run(input: input, output: output);
  });
}
```

**Rationale:** The build hook automatically compiles the Rust library during `dart pub get`, eliminating manual compilation steps and ensuring the native library is always synchronized with the Dart code. The asset name follows the package naming convention for native assets.

### Task 1.6: Verify Build System Works
**Location:** Build verification commands

Executed the following verification steps:
1. Ran `dart pub get` - Successfully resolved dependencies with pinned native_toolchain_rs commit
2. Ran `cargo check` - Successfully compiled all Rust dependencies and verified code validity (1 minute compile time)
3. Verified native library generation in `/Users/fabier/Documents/code/surrealdartb/target/debug/`:
   - `libsurrealdartb_bindings.a` (1.4 GB static library)
   - `libsurrealdartb_bindings.dylib` (120 MB dynamic library)

**Rationale:** Comprehensive build verification ensures the entire build infrastructure is correctly configured before proceeding with FFI implementation. The successful compilation confirms that all dependencies are compatible and the build system is functional.

## Database Changes
Not applicable - this task focused on build infrastructure configuration only.

## Dependencies

### Modified Dependencies
- `native_toolchain_rs` - Changed from pub.dev version `^0.1.2` to git dependency with commit `34fc6155224d844f70b3fc631fb0b0049c4d51c6` and path `native_toolchain_rs`

**Reason for change:** Standards compliance (rust-integration.md) requires git dependencies with pinned commits for native toolchain packages to ensure reproducible builds.

### Existing Dependencies Verified
- `ffi: ^2.1.0` - Required for Dart FFI functionality
- `hooks: ^0.20.4` - Required for build hook system
- `lints: ^6.0.0` - Code quality and style enforcement
- `test: ^1.25.6` - Testing framework

### Configuration Changes
- Updated `pubspec.yaml` to use git dependency for native_toolchain_rs with pinned commit hash
- Added `path: native_toolchain_rs` to git dependency specification to handle monorepo structure

  - Automatically installed/selected by rustup when building
  - Ensures consistent Rust version across all development environments

### Dependencies
- **native_toolchain_rs:** Git commit 34fc6155224d844f70b3fc631fb0b0049c4d51c6
  - Provides RustBuilder for automatic Rust compilation
  - Manages native asset compilation and linking

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified - all build infrastructure tasks completed successfully.

### Limitations
1. **Platform Testing Limited to macOS**
   - Description: Build verification only performed on macOS (primary platform)
   - Impact: Cross-platform compatibility not yet verified on iOS, Android, Windows, or Linux
   - Reason: Per spec requirements, macOS is the primary development platform; other platforms will be tested in future phases
   - Future Consideration: Multi-platform CI/CD should be set up to verify builds on all supported platforms

2. **Large Debug Binary Size**
   - Description: Debug build produces 1.4 GB static library and 120 MB dynamic library
   - Impact: Development builds consume significant disk space
   - Reason: Debug builds include full debug symbols for all dependencies including SurrealDB
   - Future Consideration: Release builds (with strip = true) will be significantly smaller; consider implementing separate debug profiles with fewer features

3. **Initial Compilation Time**
   - Description: First Rust compilation takes approximately 1 minute
   - Impact: Initial `dart pub get` or clean builds require patience
   - Reason: SurrealDB has 400+ transitive dependencies that must be compiled
   - Future Consideration: Incremental compilation is much faster (seconds); consider sccache or similar for shared build caching in teams

## Performance Considerations
- Build hook adds approximately 1 minute to initial `dart pub get` on clean builds
- Subsequent builds use Rust's incremental compilation, typically completing in seconds
- Release builds will be significantly smaller due to LTO, strip, and opt-level = "z" settings
- Binary size optimizations configured in Cargo.toml will be most apparent in release builds

## Security Considerations
- Using pinned git commit for native_toolchain_rs prevents supply chain attacks from unexpected updates
- Rust toolchain version pinning ensures consistent security patches across environments
- SurrealDB configured with minimal features reduces attack surface
- No network access required during build process (all dependencies cached locally after first fetch)

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
This task is a prerequisite for all subsequent tasks:
- **Task Group 2 (Rust FFI Layer):** Requires working build system to compile Rust FFI code
- **Task Group 3 (Dart FFI Bindings):** Requires native library to be available for FFI declarations
- **Task Group 4-7:** All depend on the build infrastructure established in this task

## Notes

### Commit Hash Selection
The native_toolchain_rs commit hash (34fc6155224d844f70b3fc631fb0b0049c4d51c6) was selected based on:
- It's the latest commit on the main branch as of October 21, 2025
- It corresponds to the tagged release v0.1.2+3 from October 18, 2025
- It's less than 1 week old, meeting the "no older than 3 months" requirement
- Being a tagged release provides additional stability guarantees

### Monorepo Path Specification
The `path: native_toolchain_rs` specification in pubspec.yaml is required because the GregoryConrad/native_toolchain_rs repository uses a workspace structure with multiple packages. Without this path specification, Dart would try to resolve the package from the repository root, which would fail.

### Future Build Optimizations
Consider implementing:
- Cargo build cache sharing (sccache) for team development
- Separate Cargo feature profiles for development vs. production
- Conditional compilation flags to exclude debug features in release builds
- Pre-built native libraries for common platforms to speed up CI/CD

### Platform-Specific Notes
- macOS builds produce .dylib (dynamic library) and .a (static library)
- iOS will use the static library (.a) exclusively
- Android requires separate builds for each architecture (handled by RustBuilder)
- Windows builds will produce .dll and .lib files
- Linux builds will produce .so files

### Rust Dependency Count
The project transitively depends on 400+ Rust crates, primarily from:
- SurrealDB core and its database backends (RocksDB)
- Tokio async runtime and related crates
- Serialization libraries (serde, serde_json)
- Various utility crates

This is normal for a database library and is the reason for the 1-minute initial compilation time.
